    "text": "1.1 Is it appropriate to define intelligence?\nRegarding the philosophical nature of precisely defining intelligence, “we have, no doubt, a rough and ready idea of what we mean by ‘intelligence’ and other cognate terms. The objective of scientific enquiry is to advance beyond this primitive, common-sense understanding (what is often termed ‘folk psychology’) to a more securely grounded set of scientific theories, based on empirical evidence and capable of ordering the world in possibly new and illuminating ways. We shall not achieve this goal by insisting on a rigorous, precise definition of terms at the outset. New definitions are the end product of scientific enquiry, not its starting point” (Mackintosh 2011, 2)\nWe ask ourselves, “what is intelligence?” (eg. is it: processing speed; reaction time; working memory; verbal ability; spatial ability; rationality; practical intelligence; emotional intelligence etc;) Imagine a variable that predicts how someone does generally in all of these abilities. What should we call this variable?"

    "text": "1.2 The g factor\nThe variable described above is commonly referred to as the “general factor of intelligence” or g factor. The g factor is a statistical construct that represents an individual’s overall intelligence level, and it is considered to be a fundamental concept in the field of psychology.\nThe existence of the g factor has been supported by decades of research across a wide range of intelligence tests and measures. For example, individuals who perform well on one cognitive task, such as verbal ability, tend to perform well on other cognitive tasks, such as spatial ability, indicating a positive correlation between various cognitive abilities.\nMoreover, the g factor has been found to predict a range of important life outcomes, such as academic and job performance, income level, and even health outcomes. Therefore, the g factor is not only a theoretical construct, but it also has practical implications for our understanding of human abilities and potential.\nNobody has ever been able to come up with an assessment for any sort of cognitive ability which does not correlate with the rest of them. The intercorrelations are caused by a general underlying factor which consistently explains half of the variance in a battery of cognitive ability tests (Mackintosh 2011, 45); (Deary 2001, 222); (Deary 1998); (Lubinski 2004, 98)."

    "section": "1.3 The CHC model",
    "text": "1.3 The CHC model\nThe Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory of intelligence is a prominent model that attempts to explain the structure of cognitive abilities. The theory proposes that intelligence is composed of a hierarchical structure of three strata: the general factor (g factor), broad abilities, and narrow abilities.\n\n\n\nCattell–Horn–Carroll theory of intelligence\n\n\nAt the top of the hierarchy is the g factor, which represents a general factor of intelligence that is common to all cognitive tasks. The broad abilities, located in the middle stratum, are a group of abilities that are less general than the g factor but still encompass a range of related cognitive tasks. Examples of broad abilities include fluid reasoning, crystallized intelligence, processing speed, and working memory. Finally, the narrow abilities, located at the bottom stratum, are specific abilities that are highly specialized and task-specific.\nThe CHC theory supports the existence of the g factor by showing that performance on different cognitive tasks is highly correlated, indicating a common underlying factor that influences performance across tasks. In addition, factor analyses of a wide range of intelligence tests consistently reveal a strong first factor that represents the g factor.\nMoreover, the CHC theory provides a framework for understanding the relationships between the g factor and other cognitive abilities. For example, fluid reasoning is considered a broad ability that is strongly related to the g factor and is involved in abstract thinking and problem-solving. Crystallized intelligence, on the other hand, is a broad ability that represents the application of knowledge and skills acquired through experience and education and is less strongly related to the g factor.\nBecause it has an impressive body of empirical support in the research literature (e.g., developmental, neurocognitive, outcome‐criterion), this model of intelligence is the one that psychologists predominantly use. It is used extensively as the foundation for selecting, organizing, and interpreting tests of intelligence and cognitive abilities. (Alfonso et al. 2005);(Beal 2006);(McGrew et al. 2005);(Schneider et al. 2012) Additionally, this model is the most comprehensive and empirically supported psychometric theory of the structure of cognitive abilities to date. (Flanagan and Dixon 2014)\nCHC is the best model from exploratory factor analysis (J. B. Carroll, B, and Press 1993) and is confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis (Gustafsson 1984); (J. Carroll 2003) (Jewsbury, Bowden, and Duff 2017). Confirmatory factor analysis showed that purposely different IQ batteries (CAB, Hawaii Battery, WAIS, etc) were analyzed, and it turned out that the g factors computed from the respective tests were statistically indistinguishable from one another, despite the fact that the tests tapped into partly different sets of abilities.

    "section": "2.1 The Positive Manifold",
    "text": "2.1 The Positive Manifold\nThe positive manifold refers to the observation that all intelligence subtests, including scholastic and social intelligence tests, correlate positively. This pattern indicates that intelligence can be measured as a composite score derived from various cognitive abilities.\nThe consistency of this positive correlation, known as the g factor, has been observed even in tests initially designed to measure other traits or abilities. Since it is so easy for cognitive batteries to measure intelligence, some tests that were created with the intention of measuring more narrow abilities end up unintentionally measuring the g-factor. For example, the Cognitive Assessment System (CAS) and the Cognitive Abilities Measurement (CAM) battery were both designed to measure cognitive processes – not g, but they still measure g anyway (Keith, Kranzler, and Flanagan 2001); (Stauffer, Ree, and Carretta 1996). Confirmatory factor analysis showed that different cognitive batteries (CAB, Hawaii Battery, WAIS) were analyzed, and it turned out that the g factors computed from the three tests (five tests in Johnson 2008) were statistically indistinguishable from one another, despite the fact that the tests tapped into partly different sets of abilities (Johnson et al. 2004); (Johnson, Nijenhuis, and Bouchard 2008)."

    "section": "2.2 Are intelligence tests reliable?",
    "text": "2.2 Are intelligence tests reliable?\nIntelligence tests are among the most reliable and valid psychological tests and assessments and as such, they are used extensively in educational, organizational, and clinical settings (Detterman 2014).\nAccording to the Wikipedia page on IQ:\nThe most commonly used individual IQ test series is the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) for adults and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) for school-age test-takers. Other commonly used individual IQ tests (some of which do not label their standard scores as “IQ” scores) include the current versions of the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales, Woodcock–Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities…\nFor brevity, I will only focus on the first four tests mentioned: WAIS, WISC, SB5, and WJ-IV.\n\n2.2.1 Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)\nAccording to a review by Climie and Rostad (2011)\n\nInternal consistency. The WAIS-IV’s reliability was measured using split-half and Cronbach’s coefficient alpha. All reported values were based on U.S. norms. The average reliability coefficients for the subtest scores ranged from acceptable (.78) to excellent (≥.90), while the four composite scores had excellent reliability coefficients (all ≥.90), with the FSIQ reporting a reliability coefficient of .98.\nTest-retest reliability. Test-retest reliabilities were obtained using Pearson’s product-moment correlation for four age bands (16-29, 30-54, 55-69, and 70-90), with time intervals between testing ranging from 8 to 82 days and a mean of 22 days. Overall, the WAIS-IV has acceptable stability across time for each of the four age bands. Subtest stability coefficients range from adequate (.74) to excellent (.90), with a majority of scores falling within the good range (.80s). Composite scores ranged from .87 to .96, with the FSIQ stability coefficient reaching an excellent value of .96.\nInterrater reliability. To ascertain acceptable levels of interrater reliability, all WAIS-IV protocols were scored by two independent scorers. General interrater agreement was high (.98 to .99), and for the verbal subtests, raters obtained excellent levels of reliability, ranging from .91 to .97.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC)\nAccording to a review by Cormier, Kennedy, and Aquilina (2016)\n\nThe formula used to calculate internal consistency reliability was recommended by Guilford (1954), Haertel (2006), and Nunnally and Bernstein (1994).\nFisher’s z transformation was used to calculate the average reliability coefficients.\nInternal consistency reliability for composite, subtest, and process scores ranges from r = .80 to r = .96.\nThe split-half method was used to calculate the reliability coefficients for all subtests, except for Coding, Symbol Search, Cancellation, Naming Speed Literacy, Naming Speed Quantity, Immediate Symbol Translation, or Delayed Symbol Translation subtests.\nThe average reliability coefficient for FSIQ is r = .96.\nThe average reliability coefficients for the primary and secondary subtests range from r = .81 to r = .94.\nThe process scores reliability coefficients range from r = .80 to r = .85.\nThe overall reliability coefficients for the primary index scores range from r = .88 to r = .93, and for the ancillary index scores range from r = .92 to r = .95.\nTest-retest reliability coefficients ranged from r = .71 to r = .94, with a mean test-retest interval of 26 days.\nEvidence of inter-scorer agreement was obtained, with the range of inter-scorer agreement being r = .98 to r = .99.\nThe average of the reliability coefficients for primary and secondary subtests from the WISC-VCDN ranges from good to excellent.\nThe reliability estimates for the WISC-VCDN scores demonstrate strong precision, which contributes to minimizing the effects of error in the measurement of the targeted abilities.\n\nAccording to a review by G. Canivez and Watkins (2016)\n\nReliability estimates of WISC-V scores reported in the WISC-V Technical and Interpretive Manual were derived using three methods: internal consistency, test-retest (stability), and interscorer agreement.\nInternal consistency was measured through the use of split-half and Cronbach’s coefficient alpha, with data provided for each of the 15 core and supplemental subtests and five composite scores (including the FSIQ).\nTest-retest reliabilities were obtained through repeated administration of the WAIS-IV, with time intervals between testing ranging from 8 to 82 days and a mean of 22 days.\nTo ascertain acceptable levels of interrater reliability, all WAIS-IV protocols were scored by two independent scorers.\nAverage coefficients across the 11 age groups for the composite scores ranged from .88 to .96 and were higher than those obtained for subtests and process scores.\nInternal consistency estimates for the primary and secondary subtests ranged from .81 to .94 while process scores ranged from .80 to .88.\nReliability estimates for the complementary subtests, process, and composite scores are provided.\nStandard errors of measurement based on reliability coefficients are presented in Table 4.4 of the WISC-V Technical and Interpretive Manual.\nShort-term test-retest stability estimates were provided for WISC-V scores where the WISC-V was twice administered to a sample of 218 children.\nInterscorer agreement ranged from .97 to .99.\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales, Fifth Edition (SB-V)\nAccording to a review by Janzen, Obrzut, and Marusiak (2004)\n\nThe internal consistency (split-half reliability) for the Full Scale IQ (FSIQ), Nonverbal IQ (NVIQ), and Verbal IQ (VIQ) ranges between .95 and .98; for the five Factor Indices, it is between .90 and .92; and, for the ten subtests, it ranges between .84 and .89.\nIQ scores on the SB:V appear to be quite stable across time and less affected by practice effects.\nThe median inter-scorer correlation is .90, and correlations on multiple-point responses (0, 1, 2) range from .74 to .97.\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Woodcock–Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities\nAccording to a review by G. L. Canivez (2017)\n\nInternal consistency reliabilities for untimed tests and dichotomously scored items were estimated with the split-half method, whereas tests with subtests and cluster reliabilities were estimated with Mosier’s (1943) formula for unweighted composites.\nReliability for speeded tests was estimated using the test-retest method with a 1-day retest interval, and correlations were corrected for range restriction.\nMedian reliability coefficients were uniformly high: 38 of 39 were .80 or higher, and 17 were .90 or higher. Test-retest correlations for speeded tests were mostly in the .80 to .90 range.\nCluster scores include two or more tests and as such produce higher reliability estimates as predicted by true score theory. The WJ IV technical manual recommended using cluster scores in interpretation, especially when used in individual decision-making.\nModel-based reliability coefficients (omega hierarchical) could be assessed to determine unique true score variance captured by the different scores.\nAlternate forms equivalence was examined and item difficulty and content were found to be similar among the forms.\n\nAccording to Madle (2017)\n\nMedian internal consistency coefficient for WJ IV COG GIA score is .97, with median coefficients of .95 to .97 for different age groups\nGf-Gc reliability coefficients range from .94 to .98 (median = .96)\nBIA reliability coefficient median is .94 (.92-.95)\nMedian coefficients for the various cognitive clusters range from .86 (Visual Processing) to .91 (Short-Term Working Memory)\nOral Language reliability coefficients range from .89 for Oral Expression to .92 for Broad Oral Language\nAcademic cluster median reliability coefficients range from .92 to .97, with a Broad Achievement score median reliability coefficient of .99\nTest-retest studies were completed for speeded tests only, and median reliability coefficients ranged from .88 to .92 for three different age groups\nEquivalence of item difficulties and item content for the achievement forms was examined and found to be strong."

    "section": "3.1 Evidences of test bias",
    "text": "3.1 Evidences of test bias\nThere has been much debate around the potential bias of intelligence tests. However, research has consistently shown that intelligence tests, when administered and scored correctly, are not biased against any particular group or population.\nIn fact, intelligence tests are designed to be culturally fair and measure cognitive abilities that are not tied to any specific cultural or socioeconomic group. The tests are created using a rigorous process that involves extensive pilot testing, item analysis, and psychometric evaluation.\nExpert opinion finds that “the issue of test bias is scientifically dead” (Hunter and Schmidt 2000, 151) “There exists, in contrast to the position of the late 1960s, a substantial body of research addressing the cultural test bias hypothesis, and scholars have extensively reviewed this literature in book and chapter-length forums (A. R. Jensen 1980); (Cecil R. Reynolds 1995); (Cecil R. Reynolds 1998); (Cecil R. Reynolds and Brown 1984). Essentially, these reviews have concluded that well-constructed, reliable, well-standardized psychological tests are not biased against native-born American racial or ethnic minorities. Studies of cultural bias in testing do occasionally reveal bias in some aspects of validity, but the bias is more likely to favor minorities in a predictive context” (Cecil R. Reynolds 2000);(Cecil R. Reynolds and Suzuki 2012)\nIn 1982, the National Research Council and the National Academy of Sciences found that “ability tests predict equally well for all groups of test takers. Research evidence does not support the notion that tests systematically underpredict the performance of minority group members” (Wigdor 1982) In 1994, Mainstream Science on Intelligence, a statement issued by several researchers, finds that “Intelligence tests are not culturally biased against American blacks or other native-born, English-speaking peoples in the U.S. Rather, IQ scores predict equally accurately for all such Americans, regardless of race and social class. Individuals who do not understand English well can be given either a nonverbal test or one in their native language.” (Gottfredson 1997). In 1996, the American Psychological Association found that “considered as predictors of future performance, the tests do not seem to be biased against African Americans.” (Neisser et al. 1996). (Reeve and Charles 2008) found that there is a consensus among intelligence experts that cognitive ability tests are not bias against minority groups\nAnd most important of all: logical and empirical examination: If intelligence tests merely measure knowledge or conformity to Western middle-class culture is the fact that the racial group with the highest average on these tests is not Europeans, but East Asians; this has been true since the 1920s (Goodenough 1926). If intelligence tests measure acculturation to Western culture, then indigenous communities who have had more contact with Europeans should score higher than people in communities in the same nation who have had less contact. However, this is not the case (Porteus 1965).\nContent of many test formats (e.g., matrix tests, digit span) contains very little information that is unique to Western culture. It is not clear how numbers or geometric patterns are special to Western middle-class individuals. Expert rated culturally loaded test items do not contribute to an increase in the Black/White divide. (Arthur R. Jensen and McGurk 1987) If test items were culturally loaded, (especially to a degree that would significantly change test results) this would mean test items ranked by difficulty would not correlate well by race. However, the opposite is true. (Cecil R. Reynolds and Suzuki 2012) Correlation of rank order difficulty between cognitive batteries is nearly perfect among Blacks and Whites."

(Schimmack 2017) We have even had papers that are completely fabricated (probably for political motivation). (Flores et al. 2021) We have a few meta analyses on this phenomenon. Publication bias plagues many of these studies and when factored for, the effect sizes decrease. (Flore and Wicherts 2015);(Shewach, Sackett, and Quint 2019), a meta-analysis of 212 experimental studies on stereotype threat, which included a total of more than 10,000 adult participants effects (the largest to date) ‘range[d] from negligible to small’ If we assume stereotype threat is an actual possible influential factor, we would actually expect Black people to have increased scores as they measure higher than whites on various psychological metrics\nCompared to Whites, Blacks have higher self-esteem (Twenge and Crocker 2002), Lower suicide rates (Curtin, Brown, and Jordan 2022), Lower rates of stress (Krueger, Saint Onge, and Chang 2011), Lower risk for panic disorder, Lower risk for generalized anxiety order, Lower risk for social phobia (Breslau et al. 2006), Lower rates for depressive disorder (Riolo et al. 2005), Lower overall rate of mental disorders (Coleman et al. 2016). Since Black people are more confident and mentally healthy, it doesn’t seem like stereotype threat could be a relevant factor. In conclusion: the evidence points to there being no cultural bias in IQ testing and there doesn’t seem to be enough methodologically robust literature to make a certain claim on stereotype threat (though more recent analyses that factor for publication bias show null effects). The burden of proof rests on those who claim this to significantly affect the gap between blacks and whites.\n\n\n\n\nBreslau, Joshua, Sergio Aguilar-Gaxiola, Kenneth S.

    "text": "The theory of IQ as the measure of general intelligence is mainstream. The American Psychological Association’s authoritative task force on intelligence stated that the theory of general intelligence is “the most widely accepted current view” (Neisser et al. 1996, 81).\nFifty-eight percent of APA respondents favor some form of a general intelligence solution, whereas 13% feel separate faculties are superior. Only 16% think the data are sufficiently ambiguous as to not favor either solution. (Snyderman and Rothman 1987, 140)\nMainstream Science on Intelligence, a Wallstreet Journal editorial with 52 signatories of 25 conclusions that represent the mainstream, Gottfredson writes that “Intelligence is a very general mental capability … it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings …” Of the invitation sent out to 131 researchers, only 11 responded that one or more of the conclusions did not represent the mainstream. (Gottfredson 1997)\nIn a conference attended by leading experts on human intelligence Michael Rutter, who is known for his moderate views, said: “All of us accept [g’s] reality. It is not merely a statistical artifact, rather, it really does represent something that is biologically important” (Rutter 2000, 282). One of the most prominent critics of general intelligence had to concede: “The evidence in favor of a general factor of intelligence is, in one sense, overwhelming … One would have to be blind or intransigent not to give this evidence its due” (Sternberg 2003, 375)\nMost recently, a survey of expert opinion on intelligence finds that “76% favored a general factor perspective” noting that “Experts favored a g factor perspective” (Rindermann, Becker, and Coyle 2020, 4)\n\n\n\n\nGottfredson, Linda S. 1997. “Mainstream Science on Intelligence: An Editorial with 52 Signatories, History, and Bibliography.” Intelligence 24 (1): 13–23. https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/S0160-2896(97)90011-8.\n\n\nNeisser, Ulric, Gwyneth Boodoo, Thomas J.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The “threshold hypothesis” states that increased IQ does not lead to additional benefits- though the actual line of the threshold is disputed. (Gladwell 2008) states that the threshold is at an IQ of 120 (which would mean mathematically that over 90 percent of the population experience noticeable benefits with higher IQ). A different estimate by (Feldman 1984) says that the threshold is about IQ 150 (which excludes less than 1 percent of the population).\nBased on the best available research, the threshold hypothesis is incorrect. Data from large samples of high-IQ people show that the likelihood of beneficial life outcomes continues to increase as people get smarter. The best research on the threshold hypothesis comes from SMPY. In the SMPY sample, there are over 2,300 people who have IQs of 135 or higher – the top 1% of the population. Even within this bright group, IQ was positively correlated with favorable work and educational outcomes. For sample members in the top quarter of the top 1%, the odds of earning a doctorate were 3.56 times higher than for people whose IQ was “only” in the bottom quarter of the top 1%. In the SMPY sample, the odds of a person in the brighter group were also higher for having an income in the top 5% of incomes nationwide (2.31 times greater); earning a patent (3.01 times greater); publishing a literary work (4.55 times greater); and publishing scholarly work in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (4.97 times greater). There was no apparent threshold where the probability of any accomplishments leveled off or decreased (Lubinski 2009). Selecting an even higher threshold of an IQ of 156 (the top 0.01% of the population, or the top 1 in 10,000 people) does not diminish the threshold effect. Over 50% of SMPY sample members with IQs of 156 or higher earned doctorates, while “only” 30% of the top 0.5% (IQ of 139 or higher) earned a doctorate (Lubinski 2009) (In comparison, 1.8% of the US adult population has earned a doctorate).\nMoreover, people with IQ scores in the top 1 in 10,000 rise to the top echelons of leadership and productivity in their careers at such a high rate that, “many are outstanding creators of modern culture, constituting a precious human-capital resource” (Kell, Lubinski, and Benbow 2013, 648). The results of SMPY have been replicated. (Wai 2014, 76) found that within a sample of 1,536 teenagers with IQ scores in the top 1% (IQ of 135 or higher), the smartest 25% earned doctorates at a rate that was 1.52 times. greater than the least intelligent 25%. Another sample of individuals with IQs in the top 1 in 10,000 of the population had similar levels of high education achievement, work productivity, and eminence within their fields as was found in the SMPY sample (Makel et al. 2016). (Coyle 2015) reported data from two studies on the relationship between intelligence and college grade point averages and found that the correlation was constant across the entire range of intelligence levels. In other words, there was no point at which greater levels of intelligence failed to increase the probability of a high grade point average in college. In a sample of gifted children, (Ruf 2005) found that as IQ increased, children were better able to move through the K-12 curriculum quickly and were increasingly more likely to display early academic development, such as learning to read by age. Successively brighter groups also mastered advanced academic material at younger and younger ages. Another study that disproves the threshold hypothesis showed that in a large sample of medical school graduates higher scores on achievement tests needed to obtain a medical license were always associated with higher levels of competence in practice (Wakeford et al. 2018).\n\n\n\n\nCoyle, Thomas R. 2015. “Relations Among General Intelligence (g), Aptitude Tests, and GPA: Linear Effects Dominate.” Intelligence 53: 16–22. https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2015.08.005.\n\n\nFeldman, David Henry. 1984. “A Follow-up of Subjects Scoring Above 180 IQ in Terman’s ‘Genetic Studies of Genius’.” Exceptional Children 50 (6): 518–23. https://doi.org/10.1177/001440298405000604.\n\n\nGladwell, M. 2008.

In the best study on this topic (Guldemond et al. 2007), children above IQs of 130 and 144 did not have more social or emotional problems than children with IQs in the 110s and 120s. Ironically, the evidence indicates that high intelligence may be a protective factor against at least some forms of psychiatric illness (Savage et al. 2018); (Walker et al. 2002). This is especially apparent in GWAS results, which show that some of the DNA segments associated with higher IQ are often negatively correlated with mental health problems (Hill et al. 2019); (Savage et al. 2018); (Sniekers et al. 2017), which makes it especially unlikely that people with very high IQs experience more psychiatric illnesses. An important exception to this general trend is autism spectrum disorder, which seems to share some genes in common with high intelligence (Hill et al. 2019); (Savage et al. 2018); (Sniekers et al. 2017).
