    "text": "1.1 Is it appropriate to define intelligence?\nRegarding the philosophical nature of precisely defining intelligence, “we have, no doubt, a rough and ready idea of what we mean by ‘intelligence’ and other cognate terms. The objective of scientific enquiry is to advance beyond this primitive, common-sense understanding (what is often termed ‘folk psychology’) to a more securely grounded set of scientific theories, based on empirical evidence and capable of ordering the world in possibly new and illuminating ways. We shall not achieve this goal by insisting on a rigorous, precise definition of terms at the outset. New definitions are the end product of scientific enquiry, not its starting point” (Mackintosh 2011, 2)\nWe ask ourselves, “what is intelligence?” (eg. is it: processing speed; reaction time; working memory; verbal ability; spatial ability; rationality; practical intelligence; emotional intelligence etc;) Imagine a variable that predicts how someone does generally in all of these abilities. What should we call this variable?"

    "text": "1.2 The g factor\nThe variable described above is commonly referred to as the “general factor of intelligence” or g factor. The g factor is a statistical construct that represents an individual’s overall intelligence level, and it is considered to be a fundamental concept in the field of psychology.\nThe existence of the g factor has been supported by decades of research across a wide range of intelligence tests and measures. For example, individuals who perform well on one cognitive task, such as verbal ability, tend to perform well on other cognitive tasks, such as spatial ability, indicating a positive correlation between various cognitive abilities.\nMoreover, the g factor has been found to predict a range of important life outcomes, such as academic and job performance, income level, and even health outcomes. Therefore, the g factor is not only a theoretical construct, but it also has practical implications for our understanding of human abilities and potential.\nNobody has ever been able to come up with an assessment for any sort of cognitive ability which does not correlate with the rest of them. The intercorrelations are caused by a general underlying factor which consistently explains half of the variance in a battery of cognitive ability tests (Mackintosh 2011, 45); (Deary 2001, 222); (Deary 1998); (Lubinski 2004, 98)."

    "section": "1.3 The CHC model",
    "text": "1.3 The CHC model\nThe Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory of intelligence is a prominent model that attempts to explain the structure of cognitive abilities. The theory proposes that intelligence is composed of a hierarchical structure of three strata: the general factor (g factor), broad abilities, and narrow abilities.\n\n\n\nCattell–Horn–Carroll theory of intelligence\n\n\nAt the top of the hierarchy is the g factor, which represents a general factor of intelligence that is common to all cognitive tasks. The broad abilities, located in the middle stratum, are a group of abilities that are less general than the g factor but still encompass a range of related cognitive tasks. Examples of broad abilities include fluid reasoning, crystallized intelligence, processing speed, and working memory. Finally, the narrow abilities, located at the bottom stratum, are specific abilities that are highly specialized and task-specific.\nThe CHC theory supports the existence of the g factor by showing that performance on different cognitive tasks is highly correlated, indicating a common underlying factor that influences performance across tasks. In addition, factor analyses of a wide range of intelligence tests consistently reveal a strong first factor that represents the g factor.\nMoreover, the CHC theory provides a framework for understanding the relationships between the g factor and other cognitive abilities. For example, fluid reasoning is considered a broad ability that is strongly related to the g factor and is involved in abstract thinking and problem-solving. Crystallized intelligence, on the other hand, is a broad ability that represents the application of knowledge and skills acquired through experience and education and is less strongly related to the g factor.\nBecause it has an impressive body of empirical support in the research literature (e.g., developmental, neurocognitive, outcome‐criterion), this model of intelligence is the one that psychologists predominantly use. It is used extensively as the foundation for selecting, organizing, and interpreting tests of intelligence and cognitive abilities. (Alfonso et al. 2005);(Beal 2006);(McGrew et al. 2005);(Schneider et al. 2012) Additionally, this model is the most comprehensive and empirically supported psychometric theory of the structure of cognitive abilities to date. (Flanagan and Dixon 2014)\nCHC is the best model from exploratory factor analysis (J. B. Carroll, B, and Press 1993) and is confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis (Gustafsson 1984); (J. Carroll 2003) (Jewsbury, Bowden, and Duff 2017). Confirmatory factor analysis showed that purposely different IQ batteries (CAB, Hawaii Battery, WAIS, etc) were analyzed, and it turned out that the g factors computed from the respective tests were statistically indistinguishable from one another, despite the fact that the tests tapped into partly different sets of abilities.

    "section": "2.1 The Positive Manifold",
    "text": "2.1 The Positive Manifold\nThe positive manifold refers to the observation that all intelligence subtests, including scholastic and social intelligence tests, correlate positively. This pattern indicates that intelligence can be measured as a composite score derived from various cognitive abilities.\nThe consistency of this positive correlation, known as the g factor, has been observed even in tests initially designed to measure other traits or abilities. Since it is so easy for cognitive batteries to measure intelligence, some tests that were created with the intention of measuring more narrow abilities end up unintentionally measuring the g-factor. For example, the Cognitive Assessment System (CAS) and the Cognitive Abilities Measurement (CAM) battery were both designed to measure cognitive processes – not g, but they still measure g anyway (Keith, Kranzler, and Flanagan 2001); (Stauffer, Ree, and Carretta 1996). Confirmatory factor analysis showed that different cognitive batteries (CAB, Hawaii Battery, WAIS) were analyzed, and it turned out that the g factors computed from the three tests (five tests in Johnson 2008) were statistically indistinguishable from one another, despite the fact that the tests tapped into partly different sets of abilities (Johnson et al. 2004); (Johnson, Nijenhuis, and Bouchard 2008)."

    "section": "2.2 Are intelligence tests reliable?",
    "text": "2.2 Are intelligence tests reliable?\nIntelligence tests are among the most reliable and valid psychological tests and assessments and as such, they are used extensively in educational, organizational, and clinical settings (Detterman 2014).\nAccording to the Wikipedia page on IQ:\nThe most commonly used individual IQ test series is the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) for adults and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) for school-age test-takers. Other commonly used individual IQ tests (some of which do not label their standard scores as “IQ” scores) include the current versions of the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales, Woodcock–Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities…\nFor brevity, I will only focus on the first four tests mentioned: WAIS, WISC, SB5, and WJ-IV.\n\n2.2.1 Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)\nAccording to a review by Climie and Rostad (2011)\n\nInternal consistency. The WAIS-IV’s reliability was measured using split-half and Cronbach’s coefficient alpha. All reported values were based on U.S. norms. The average reliability coefficients for the subtest scores ranged from acceptable (.78) to excellent (≥.90), while the four composite scores had excellent reliability coefficients (all ≥.90), with the FSIQ reporting a reliability coefficient of .98.\nTest-retest reliability. Test-retest reliabilities were obtained using Pearson’s product-moment correlation for four age bands (16-29, 30-54, 55-69, and 70-90), with time intervals between testing ranging from 8 to 82 days and a mean of 22 days. Overall, the WAIS-IV has acceptable stability across time for each of the four age bands. Subtest stability coefficients range from adequate (.74) to excellent (.90), with a majority of scores falling within the good range (.80s). Composite scores ranged from .87 to .96, with the FSIQ stability coefficient reaching an excellent value of .96.\nInterrater reliability. To ascertain acceptable levels of interrater reliability, all WAIS-IV protocols were scored by two independent scorers. General interrater agreement was high (.98 to .99), and for the verbal subtests, raters obtained excellent levels of reliability, ranging from .91 to .97.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC)\nAccording to a review by Cormier, Kennedy, and Aquilina (2016)\n\nThe formula used to calculate internal consistency reliability was recommended by Guilford (1954), Haertel (2006), and Nunnally and Bernstein (1994).\nFisher’s z transformation was used to calculate the average reliability coefficients.\nInternal consistency reliability for composite, subtest, and process scores ranges from r = .80 to r = .96.\nThe split-half method was used to calculate the reliability coefficients for all subtests, except for Coding, Symbol Search, Cancellation, Naming Speed Literacy, Naming Speed Quantity, Immediate Symbol Translation, or Delayed Symbol Translation subtests.\nThe average reliability coefficient for FSIQ is r = .96.\nThe average reliability coefficients for the primary and secondary subtests range from r = .81 to r = .94.\nThe process scores reliability coefficients range from r = .80 to r = .85.\nThe overall reliability coefficients for the primary index scores range from r = .88 to r = .93, and for the ancillary index scores range from r = .92 to r = .95.\nTest-retest reliability coefficients ranged from r = .71 to r = .94, with a mean test-retest interval of 26 days.\nEvidence of inter-scorer agreement was obtained, with the range of inter-scorer agreement being r = .98 to r = .99.\nThe average of the reliability coefficients for primary and secondary subtests from the WISC-VCDN ranges from good to excellent.\nThe reliability estimates for the WISC-VCDN scores demonstrate strong precision, which contributes to minimizing the effects of error in the measurement of the targeted abilities.\n\nAccording to a review by G. Canivez and Watkins (2016)\n\nReliability estimates of WISC-V scores reported in the WISC-V Technical and Interpretive Manual were derived using three methods: internal consistency, test-retest (stability), and interscorer agreement.\nInternal consistency was measured through the use of split-half and Cronbach’s coefficient alpha, with data provided for each of the 15 core and supplemental subtests and five composite scores (including the FSIQ).\nTest-retest reliabilities were obtained through repeated administration of the WAIS-IV, with time intervals between testing ranging from 8 to 82 days and a mean of 22 days.\nTo ascertain acceptable levels of interrater reliability, all WAIS-IV protocols were scored by two independent scorers.\nAverage coefficients across the 11 age groups for the composite scores ranged from .88 to .96 and were higher than those obtained for subtests and process scores.\nInternal consistency estimates for the primary and secondary subtests ranged from .81 to .94 while process scores ranged from .80 to .88.\nReliability estimates for the complementary subtests, process, and composite scores are provided.\nStandard errors of measurement based on reliability coefficients are presented in Table 4.4 of the WISC-V Technical and Interpretive Manual.\nShort-term test-retest stability estimates were provided for WISC-V scores where the WISC-V was twice administered to a sample of 218 children.\nInterscorer agreement ranged from .97 to .99.\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales, Fifth Edition (SB-V)\nAccording to a review by Janzen, Obrzut, and Marusiak (2004)\n\nThe internal consistency (split-half reliability) for the Full Scale IQ (FSIQ), Nonverbal IQ (NVIQ), and Verbal IQ (VIQ) ranges between .95 and .98; for the five Factor Indices, it is between .90 and .92; and, for the ten subtests, it ranges between .84 and .89.\nIQ scores on the SB:V appear to be quite stable across time and less affected by practice effects.\nThe median inter-scorer correlation is .90, and correlations on multiple-point responses (0, 1, 2) range from .74 to .97.\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Woodcock–Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities\nAccording to a review by G. L. Canivez (2017)\n\nInternal consistency reliabilities for untimed tests and dichotomously scored items were estimated with the split-half method, whereas tests with subtests and cluster reliabilities were estimated with Mosier’s (1943) formula for unweighted composites.\nReliability for speeded tests was estimated using the test-retest method with a 1-day retest interval, and correlations were corrected for range restriction.\nMedian reliability coefficients were uniformly high: 38 of 39 were .80 or higher, and 17 were .90 or higher. Test-retest correlations for speeded tests were mostly in the .80 to .90 range.\nCluster scores include two or more tests and as such produce higher reliability estimates as predicted by true score theory. The WJ IV technical manual recommended using cluster scores in interpretation, especially when used in individual decision-making.\nModel-based reliability coefficients (omega hierarchical) could be assessed to determine unique true score variance captured by the different scores.\nAlternate forms equivalence was examined and item difficulty and content were found to be similar among the forms.\n\nAccording to Madle (2017)\n\nMedian internal consistency coefficient for WJ IV COG GIA score is .97, with median coefficients of .95 to .97 for different age groups\nGf-Gc reliability coefficients range from .94 to .98 (median = .96)\nBIA reliability coefficient median is .94 (.92-.95)\nMedian coefficients for the various cognitive clusters range from .86 (Visual Processing) to .91 (Short-Term Working Memory)\nOral Language reliability coefficients range from .89 for Oral Expression to .92 for Broad Oral Language\nAcademic cluster median reliability coefficients range from .92 to .97, with a Broad Achievement score median reliability coefficient of .99\nTest-retest studies were completed for speeded tests only, and median reliability coefficients ranged from .88 to .92 for three different age groups\nEquivalence of item difficulties and item content for the achievement forms was examined and found to be strong."

This guy is also the founder of the journal Intelligence so he’s a very mainstream voice in this discussion.\n(Haier 2019) states that in the field of intelligence, “there is no replication crisis about key empirical findings.” In general, “g is regarded as “perhaps the most replicated result in psychology” (Deary 2000, 318)."

    "text": "3.2 Evidences of test bias in intelligence tests\nThere has been much debate around the potential bias of intelligence tests. However, research has consistently shown that intelligence tests, when administered and scored correctly, are not biased against any particular group or population.\nIn fact, intelligence tests are designed to be culturally fair and measure cognitive abilities that are not tied to any specific cultural or socioeconomic group. The tests are created using a rigorous process that involves extensive pilot testing, item analysis, and psychometric evaluation.\nExpert opinion finds that “the issue of test bias is scientifically dead” (Hunter and Schmidt 2000, 151) “There exists, in contrast to the position of the late 1960s, a substantial body of research addressing the cultural test bias hypothesis, and scholars have extensively reviewed this literature in book and chapter-length forums (A. R. Jensen 1980); (Cecil R. Reynolds 1995); (Cecil R. Reynolds 1998); (Cecil R. Reynolds and Brown 1984). Essentially, these reviews have concluded that well-constructed, reliable, well-standardized psychological tests are not biased against native-born American racial or ethnic minorities. Studies of cultural bias in testing do occasionally reveal bias in some aspects of validity, but the bias is more likely to favor minorities in a predictive context” (Cecil R. Reynolds 2000);(Cecil R. Reynolds and Suzuki 2012)\nIn 1982, the National Research Council and the National Academy of Sciences found that “ability tests predict equally well for all groups of test takers. Research evidence does not support the notion that tests systematically underpredict the performance of minority group members” (Wigdor 1982) In 1994, Mainstream Science on Intelligence, a statement issued by several researchers, finds that “Intelligence tests are not culturally biased against American blacks or other native-born, English-speaking peoples in the U.S. Rather, IQ scores predict equally accurately for all such Americans, regardless of race and social class. Individuals who do not understand English well can be given either a nonverbal test or one in their native language.” (Gottfredson 1997). In 1996, the American Psychological Association found that “considered as predictors of future performance, the tests do not seem to be biased against African Americans.” (Neisser et al. 1996). (Reeve and Charles 2008) found that there is a consensus among intelligence experts that cognitive ability tests are not bias against minority groups\nAnd most important of all: logical and empirical examination: If intelligence tests merely measure knowledge or conformity to Western middle-class culture is the fact that the racial group with the highest average on these tests is not Europeans, but East Asians; this has been true since the 1920s (Goodenough 1926). If intelligence tests measure acculturation to Western culture, then indigenous communities who have had more contact with Europeans should score higher than people in communities in the same nation who have had less contact. However, this is not the case (Porteus 1965).\nContent of many test formats (e.g., matrix tests, digit span) contains very little information that is unique to Western culture. It is not clear how numbers or geometric patterns are special to Western middle-class individuals. Expert rated culturally loaded test items do not contribute to an increase in the Black/White divide. (Arthur R. Jensen and McGurk 1987) If test items were culturally loaded, (especially to a degree that would significantly change test results) this would mean test items ranked by difficulty would not correlate well by race. However, the opposite is true. (Cecil R. Reynolds and Suzuki 2012) Correlation of rank order difficulty between cognitive batteries is nearly perfect among Blacks and Whites."

(Flore and Wicherts 2015);(Shewach, Sackett, and Quint 2019), a meta-analysis of 212 experimental studies on stereotype threat, which included a total of more than 10,000 adult participants effects (the largest to date) ‘range[d] from negligible to small’ If we assume stereotype threat is an actual possible influential factor, we would actually expect Black people to have increased scores as they measure higher than whites on various psychological metrics\nCompared to Whites, Blacks have higher self-esteem (Twenge and Crocker 2002), Lower suicide rates (Curtin, Brown, and Jordan 2022), Lower rates of stress (Krueger, Saint Onge, and Chang 2011), Lower risk for panic disorder, Lower risk for generalized anxiety order, Lower risk for social phobia (Breslau et al. 2006), Lower rates for depressive disorder (Riolo et al. 2005), Lower overall rate of mental disorders (Coleman et al. 2016). Since Black people are more confident and mentally healthy, it doesn’t seem like stereotype threat could be a relevant factor. In conclusion: the evidence points to there being no cultural bias in IQ testing and there doesn’t seem to be enough methodologically robust literature to make a certain claim on stereotype threat (though more recent analyses that factor for publication bias show null effects). The burden of proof rests on those who claim this to significantly affect the gap between blacks and whites."

    "text": "3.4 Do scientists actually believe in general intelligence?\nThe theory of IQ as the measure of general intelligence is mainstream. The American Psychological Association’s authoritative task force on intelligence stated that the theory of general intelligence is “the most widely accepted current view” (Neisser et al. 1996, 81).\nFifty-eight percent of APA respondents favor some form of a general intelligence solution, whereas 13% feel separate faculties are superior. Only 16% think the data are sufficiently ambiguous as to not favor either solution. (Snyderman and Rothman 1987, 140)\nMainstream Science on Intelligence, a Wallstreet Journal editorial with 52 signatories of 25 conclusions that represent the mainstream, Gottfredson writes that “Intelligence is a very general mental capability … it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings …” Of the invitation sent out to 131 researchers, only 11 responded that one or more of the conclusions did not represent the mainstream. (Gottfredson 1997)\nIn a conference attended by leading experts on human intelligence Michael Rutter, who is known for his moderate views, said: “All of us accept [g’s] reality. It is not merely a statistical artifact, rather, it really does represent something that is biologically important” (Rutter 2000, 282). One of the most prominent critics of general intelligence had to concede: “The evidence in favor of a general factor of intelligence is, in one sense, overwhelming … One would have to be blind or intransigent not to give this evidence its due” (Sternberg 2003, 375)\nMost recently, a survey of expert opinion on intelligence finds that “76% favored a general factor perspective” noting that “Experts favored a g factor perspective” (Rindermann, Becker, and Coyle 2020, 4)\n\n\n\n\nBreslau, Joshua, Sergio Aguilar-Gaxiola, Kenneth S.

    "section": "4.1 Threshold hypothesis",
    "text": "4.1 Threshold hypothesis\nThe “threshold hypothesis” states that increased IQ does not lead to additional benefits- though the actual line of the threshold is disputed. (Gladwell 2008) states that the threshold is at an IQ of 120 (which would mean mathematically that over 90 percent of the population experience noticeable benefits with higher IQ). A different estimate by (Feldman 1984) says that the threshold is about IQ 150 (which excludes less than 1 percent of the population).\nBased on the best available research, the threshold hypothesis is incorrect. Data from large samples of high-IQ people show that the likelihood of beneficial life outcomes continues to increase as people get smarter. The best research on the threshold hypothesis comes from SMPY. In the SMPY sample, there are over 2,300 people who have IQs of 135 or higher – the top 1% of the population. Even within this bright group, IQ was positively correlated with favorable work and educational outcomes. For sample members in the top quarter of the top 1%, the odds of earning a doctorate were 3.56 times higher than for people whose IQ was “only” in the bottom quarter of the top 1%. In the SMPY sample, the odds of a person in the brighter group were also higher for having an income in the top 5% of incomes nationwide (2.31 times greater); earning a patent (3.01 times greater); publishing a literary work (4.55 times greater); and publishing scholarly work in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (4.97 times greater). There was no apparent threshold where the probability of any accomplishments leveled off or decreased (Lubinski 2009). Selecting an even higher threshold of an IQ of 156 (the top 0.01% of the population, or the top 1 in 10,000 people) does not diminish the threshold effect. Over 50% of SMPY sample members with IQs of 156 or higher earned doctorates, while “only” 30% of the top 0.5% (IQ of 139 or higher) earned a doctorate (Lubinski 2009) (In comparison, 1.8% of the US adult population has earned a doctorate).\nMoreover, people with IQ scores in the top 1 in 10,000 rise to the top echelons of leadership and productivity in their careers at such a high rate that, “many are outstanding creators of modern culture, constituting a precious human-capital resource” (Kell, Lubinski, and Benbow 2013, 648). The results of SMPY have been replicated. (Wai 2014, 76) found that within a sample of 1,536 teenagers with IQ scores in the top 1% (IQ of 135 or higher), the smartest 25% earned doctorates at a rate that was 1.52 times. greater than the least intelligent 25%. Another sample of individuals with IQs in the top 1 in 10,000 of the population had similar levels of high education achievement, work productivity, and eminence within their fields as was found in the SMPY sample (Makel et al. 2016). (Coyle 2015) reported data from two studies on the relationship between intelligence and college grade point averages and found that the correlation was constant across the entire range of intelligence levels. In other words, there was no point at which greater levels of intelligence failed to increase the probability of a high grade point average in college. In a sample of gifted children, (Ruf 2005) found that as IQ increased, children were better able to move through the K-12 curriculum quickly and were increasingly more likely to display early academic development, such as learning to read by age. Successively brighter groups also mastered advanced academic material at younger and younger ages. Another study that disproves the threshold hypothesis showed that in a large sample of medical school graduates higher scores on achievement tests needed to obtain a medical license were always associated with higher levels of competence in practice (Wakeford et al. 2018)."

    "text": "4.2 Aren’t people with higher IQs more likely to be mentally ill?\nFor social and emotional outcomes, there is not much evidence about whether an IQ threshold exists. In the best study on this topic (Guldemond et al. 2007), children above IQs of 130 and 144 did not have more social or emotional problems than children with IQs in the 110s and 120s. Ironically, the evidence indicates that high intelligence may be a protective factor against at least some forms of psychiatric illness (Savage et al. 2018); (Walker et al. 2002). This is especially apparent in GWAS results, which show that some of the DNA segments associated with higher IQ are often negatively correlated with mental health problems (Hill et al. 2019); (Savage et al. 2018); (Sniekers et al. 2017), which makes it especially unlikely that people with very high IQs experience more psychiatric illnesses. An important exception to this general trend is autism spectrum disorder, which seems to share some genes in common with high intelligence (Hill et al. 2019); (Savage et al. 2018); (Sniekers et al. 2017). (Williams et al. 2022) finds that high intelligence is not a risk factor for mental health disorders"

    "text": "Firstly, we have to understand that IQ is designed to be a measurement of intelligence. Like all models, it is subject to noise. The interplay between intelligence and socioeconomic status is complicated and should be treated as such. Firstly, we know that intelligence and socioeconomic status correlate but this, however, does not necessarily imply causation in any specific direction.\n(Sirin 2005) meta-analyzed data on roughly 100,000 students and found the mean correlation between cognitive ability and parental SES to be .28, indicating a moderate relationship. (Neisser et al. 1996) from the American Psychological Association task force report on intelligence explains that these two variables influence each other. A meta-analytic review of the longitudinal research on IQ and SES, found that the mean correlations between a person’s IQ measured at one point and their education, occupation status, and income, measured 10 or more years later, were .49, .41, and .22 respectively. This is significant because they were better predictors than their parental socioeconomic status. (Strenze 2007); (Murray 1998) analyzed data from the NLSY and showed that IQ differences within sibling pairs predicted future differences in SES. That is, the sibling with a higher IQ typically ended up having more education, a higher status occupation, and more income.\nBecause siblings have identical parental SES, this analysis shows that IQ leads to higher SES independent of parental SES. This is also recorded in (Lubinski 2009).\nTwin studies can additionally give insight on the variation of intelligence attributed to the common or shared environment. Common environmental influence, which includes familial socioeconomic status, influences 25 percent the variability and decreases to around 15 percent of the variability in young adulthood- the maximum amount of influence that socioeconomic factors from family could play. (Haworth et al. 2010)\nActing as a natural experiment, some evidence shows that adoption may raise IQ since adoption into a highly favorable environment would be described as an “intensive, years-long intervention that includes academic, social, and health improvements throughout childhood and adolescence” (Warne 2020) However, this kind of adoption as stated above seems to increase IQ scores of around 4 points. (Kendler et al. 2015) (though this may not be in g itself (te Nijenhuis, Jongeneel-Grimen, and Armstrong 2015)). More generally, (McGue et al. 2007) studies adoptive and non adoptive families, each consisting of an adolescent sibling pair and one or both of their parents (with comparable age and gender). This study does not find that socioeconomic status is a causal element in determining intelligence.\n\n\n\n\nHaworth, C. M. A., M. J. Wright, M. Luciano, N. G. Martin, E. J. C. de Geus, C. E.

    "text": "There are many cognitive batteries that specifically do not try to look for ‘g’, some of which expressly try to avoid it.\n\nResearchers for the British Ability Scales lament that “there is little evidence that strong primary factors… have accounted for any substantial proportion of the common variance of the British Ability Scales. This is despite the fact that the scales sample a wide range of psychological functions.” It asks What, then, are we to make of the results of these analyses? Do they mean that we are back to square one, as it were, and that after 60 years of research we have turned full circle and are back with the theories of Spearman?” (Elliott 1986).\nThe CAS Battery is based on the Soviet inspired PASS theory which disavows g and asserts that intelligence consists of four processes called Planning, Attention-Arousal, Simultaneous, and Successive. The CAS was designed to assess these four processes. However, (Keith, Kranzler, and Flanagan 2001) did a joint confirmatory factor analysis of the CAS together with the WJ-III battery, concluding that not only does the CAS not measure the constructs it was designed to measure, but that notwithstanding the test makers’ aversion to g, the g factor derived from the CAS is large and statistically indistinguishable from the g factor of the WJ-III. The CAS therefore appears to be the opposite of what it was supposed to be: an excellent test of the “non-existent” g and a poor test of the supposedly real non-g abilities it was painstakingly designed to measure.\nThe triarchic theory of intelligence originated as an alternative to the concept of general intelligence factor, or g. (Vinney 2021); (Brody 2003a), (Brody 2003b) analyzed Sternbergs work and finds a general factor of intelligence. Additionally, with tests that are radically different, Confirmatory Factor Analysis showed that different cognitive batteries (CAB, Hawaii Battery, WAIS) were analyzed, and it turned out that the g factors computed from the three tests (five tests in (Johnson, Nijenhuis, and Bouchard 2008)) were statistically indistinguishable from one another, despite the fact that the tests tapped into partly different sets of abilities. (Johnson et al. 2004), (Johnson, Nijenhuis, and Bouchard 2008).\n\nOn a biological level, it has been established beyond any dispute that cognitive abilities are heritable. (Polderman et al. 2015) Higher g-loadings correlate to higher heritabilities (Jensen 1987),(te Nijenhuis, Kura, and Hur 2014). Quantitative genetic analyses indicate that g is an even stronger genetic variable than it is a phenotypic variable.

    "text": "7.1 Is mutualism a better model for intelligence?\nMutualism, which states that “cognitive processes are initially uncorrelated, but that the positive manifold arises during individual development due to mutual beneficial relations between cognitive processes.”, has no good empirical backing. Mutualism expects that “it takes some time for the positive manifold, and thus the psychometric g factor, to emerge”, (Van Der Maas et al., 2006:851) but conversely, the proportion of variance in scale scores accounted for by a general factor is stable from age 2.5-90 (Gignac 2014) Thompson et al, (1985) even finds evidence for a genetic ‘g’ among infants. Mutualism would expect low genetic correlations among cognitive domains, however, more g-loaded tests are more heritable than the less g-loaded tests (and this exists in non humans as well). This is incredibly problematic. For example, in children, “correlations between phenotypic g loadings and genetic g loadings were 0.88 and 0.76 for the two mental test batteries.” (Deary et al., 2006) Additionally, “the effect of being raised in the same family is smaller than the effect of genes.” (Second Law of Behavioral Genetics) Mutualism fails to pass lex parsimoniae, is not generalisable, is not falsifiable, and is based mostly on post-hoc justifications. (Gignac 2016) Finally, under mutualism, we would expect changes to ‘g’ occurring after social changes and environmental impacts. However, IQ gains from adoption are not g-loaded, (Nijenhuis et al, 2015) IQ changes with education are not g-loaded (Nijenhuis et al, 2014; Ritchie et al 2015), etc BUT Gardner’s multiple theory of Intelligence is valid Gardner, the creator of the theory of multiple intelligences states that “I readily admit that the theory [of multiple intelligences] is no longer current. Several fields of knowledge have advanced significantly since the early 1980s. Any reinvigoration of the theory would require a survey similar to the one that colleagues and I carried out thirty-five years ago.” (Gardner, 2016, pp. 169–170). Hunt (2011:119), who stated that “there is virtually no objective evidence for the theory” of multiple intelligences. Gardner believes that those who espose general intelligence are “bad guys”. (Gardner, 2009, 0:45:11–0:45:32) Gardner seems to have called the abilities in his model, “intelligences” in order to “replace the current, [allegedly] largely discredited notion of intelligence as a single inherited trait” (Gardner, 2011:300).\nBy including physical abilities (in bodily-kinesthetic intelligence), personality traits (in interpersonal intelligence) and other non-cognitive traits, Gardner has stretched the word “intelligence” so much that it ceases to have any real meaning (Hunt, 2011; Jensen, 1998; Scarr, 1985). Gardner sees g as being a narrow concept that encourages “a limited view of intelligence” (von Károlyi et al., 2003), but believing in the existence of g does not preclude the existence of other abilities. In fact, both the currently accepted model of intelligence, the Cattell-Horn-Carroll model and bifactor models explicitly recognize the existence of non-g cognitive abilities\nIn order to make the theory of Multiple Intelligences, Gardner habitually cherry picks evidence in his favor and ignores evidence that contradicts his theory (Bouchard, 1984; Messick, 1992; Scarr, 1985; Snow, 1985). Frames of Mind also has the drawback of relying heavily on anecdotal data rather than any large, representative sample of individuals performing tasks grounded in his intelligences (Lubinski & Benbow, 1995).\nGardner’s theory is also unfalsifiable. Gardener states that he has “never felt that MI theory was one that could be subjected to an ‘up and down’ kind of test, or even series of tests” (Gardner, 2011, p. xix). And that he “[does] not believe that educational programs created under the aegis of MI theory lend themselves to the kinds of randomized control studies that the US government is now calling for in education” (Gardner, 2011:xxi). Gardner has stated that he does not endorse any psychological test to measure the multiple intelligences (von Károlyi et al., 2003)."

    "text": "7.2 Isn’t Emotional Intelligence or EQ more powerful than IQ?\nEmotional Intelligence, “the capacity to reason, understand, and manage emotions. In addition, emotional intelligence plausibly reflects the emotion system’s capacity to use emotion to enhance thought”. Goleman describes it as “the ability to identify, monitor and accurately use information about emotional states” After Goleman’s 1996 book, “Emotional Intelligence”, the popular psychological term became a multi-million dollar industry. (Grewal and Salovey 2005) This fad (Murphy and Sideman 2006), like other fads in psychology, is unsubstantiated by the literature. Emotional Intelligence is not actually an independent construct, it seems to just measure various other factors that predict success. (Joseph et al. 2015) reports that “62% of the variance in mixed EI is captured by Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Emotional Stability, ability EI, cognitive ability, general self-efficacy, and self-rated job performance.” which are all factors that predict success. This is also explored in (Landy 2005).\nEmotional Intelligence’s construct validity is in question as some show it may merely be a repackaged version of the Big Five personality traits (Conte 2005); (Can der Linden et al. 2018).\nDavies, Stankov, and Roberts (1998) states “Our searches of the literature revealed only six articles in which the authors either explicitly examined the incremental validity of EI scores over measures of both cognitive ability and Big Five personality traits in predicting either academic or work performance, or presented data in a manner that allowed examination of this issue. Not one of these six articles… showed a significant contribution for EI in the prediction of performance after controlling for both cognitive ability and the Big Five…\nFor correlations involving the overall EI construct, EI explained almost no incremental variance in performance [change in prediction] = .00. Findings were identical when considering only cases involving an ability-based measure of IE….”.\nHarms and Crede (2010) states “…proofs of validity [for EI] seem to come from measuring constructs that have existed for a long time and are simply being relabeled and recategorized. For example, one of the proposed measures of (Emotional and Social Competence), the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire, makes use of measures of assertiveness, social competence, self-confidence, stress management, and impulsivity among other things. Most, if not all, of these constructs, are firmly embedded in and well-accounted for by [other] well-designed measures of personality traits…\nThe substantial relationships observed between these ESC (Emotional and Social Competence) and trait-based EI measures, and personality inventories bear this out. It, therefore, appears that the predictive validity of ESC or EI measures may be accounted for in large part by the degree to which they assess sub-facets of higher-order traits relevant to the outcomes being predicted."

    "text": "7.3 Is IQ the only trait that predicts outcomes?\nAlthough intelligence is important in determining a student’s level of academic success, no one claims that intelligence is the only trait that impacts school outcomes. The correlation between IQ and measures of academic success – such as grades, standardized test scores, or how many years a person stays in school – is not perfect. That means that there is room for other abilities to exert an impact on educational performance. As Gottfredson (1997) p.116 states, “The effects of intelligence … are probabilistic, not deterministic. Higher intelligence improves the odds of success in school and work. It is an advantage, not a guarantee. Many other things matter.” It is not difficult to brainstorm a list of what these “other things” that influence success are. Psychological traits like motivation, creativity, resiliency, curiosity, industriousness, and ambition can all be important for doing well in school. Non-psychological variables like socioeconomic status, parental involvement in education, a culture that encourages academic competition, and good physical health could also have an impact on a student’s success (Warne 2016). Nobody denies this- but whether or not these variables\nThe argument among psychologists and educators is not whether non-cognitive variables can result in higher school performance. Rather, the argument is over the magnitude of the influence that these non-cognitive variables have and whether these variables are more important than intelligence in determining educational success. Personality traits have moderate importance in determining school performance, but they are hard to change. This resistance to interventions is probably because personality traits are – like almost every other psychological trait – partially influenced by genes. The heritability of personality is roughly the same as the heritability of intelligence, which may limit the malleability of personality (Bouchard 1997); (Thomas J. Bouchard 2004); (Briley and Tucker-Drob 2017). Because of the difficulty of improving school performance by altering personality, many psychologists seek non-cognitive characteristics that are both malleable and important causes of academic achievement.\n\n7.3.1 Personality traits\nThe leading theory for personality, the Five Factor model, these traits are present in many cultures and across the lifespan, and they are a robust basis for understanding personality (Allik and Realo 2017). Psychologists have conducted a great deal of research on the correlation between Big Five traits and school success. Although not perfectly consistent, this research shows that some of these traits correlate with educational outcomes. Conscientiousness has the strongest correlation, usually between r ≈ .20 and .35 (e.g., (Cucina et al. 2016); (Lechner, Danner, and Rammstedt 2017); (Poropat 2009); (Spinath, Harald Freudenthaler, and Neubauer 2010)). While this is a strong enough correlation for conscientiousness to be a noteworthy influence on school performance, it is weaker than the correlation between intelligence and academic performance, which is usually r ≈ .35 to .70 in the same studies. This indicates that intelligence is a more important influence on educational performance than conscientiousness is. The other personality traits in the Big Five have weaker relationships – in some studies as weak as zero – with academic achievement.\n\n\n7.3.2 Motivation\nThere is no denying the benefits of motivation. As one of the best non-cognitive influences on academics (Rosen et al. 2010); (Liu, Bridgeman, and Adler 2012), it is no surprise we see that motivated people set higher goals and accomplish more goals (Locke and Latham 2002). Policies that encourage motivation in children result in greater dedication to their studies and higher performance in school (e.g., (Patall, Cooper, and Robinson 2008); (Roderick and Engel 2001)).\nMotivation, school performance, and IQ are all positively correlated with one another, and it is often difficult to disentangle their influences. In regards to intelligence, research shows that highly motivated examinees earn slightly higher IQ scores (Gignac, Bartulovich, and Salleo 2019). And because staying in school longer raises IQ (Ceci 1991); (Ritchie and Tucker-Drob 2018), it is possible that academically motivated students – who choose to stay in school longer – might earn higher IQs because of their additional education. However, none of this is evidence for whether increased motivation can cause higher g. Controlling for intelligence sometimes makes the relationship between motivation and academic performance disappear (e.g., (Ziegler et al. 2010)), though not always. And it is possible that motivation’s impact on IQ is entirely on the non-g influences on test scores. It does seem clear that improving student motivation can lead to gains in educational performance (Rosen et al. 2010). Motivation seems to have a stronger effect on grades than on standardized test scores (e.g., (Cucina et al. 2016)), possibly because earning high grades requires more sustained effort. Regardless, intelligence seems to be the more important predictor, no matter how academic performance is measured. As the authors of one study stated, “cognitive abilities were by far the best predictor of school achievement” (Gagné and St Père 2001, 71). Motivation – important as it is in determining academic outcomes – still is dwarfed by the influence of intelligence and other cognitive abilities. Therefore, no amount of motivation can make up for a large IQ deficit.\n\n\n7.3.3 Mindset\nAccording to Dweck, there are two types of mindset: (a) fixed mindset and (b) growth mindset. (Dweck 2009). There are several things that growth mindset are set out to achieve, most of which are minor or even associated with negative effects. Growth mindset is only slightly associated with goal setting. (Burgoyne, Hambrick, and Macnamara 2020) finds a correlation of 0.1 between having a growth mind-set and holding learning goals. For comparison, other personality constructs have been found to correlate much more strongly with learning goal orientation: self-efficacy (r = .56), need for achievement (r = .38), and openness to experience (r = .34); (Payne, Culbertson, and Beaubien 2007). Conversely, (Burgoyne, Hambrick, and Macnamara 2020) finds no statistically significant associations between having a fixed-mindset and and performance goals. People with growth mindsets are not more intelligent. If anything, it is the opposite. (Macnamara and Rupani 2017) find a insignificant correlation between mind-set and intelligence RMP (β = -0.04) (Burgoyne, Hambrick, and Macnamara 2020) interestingly finds that mind-set has a very small negative correlation with cognitive ability tests. CFIT-4 (β = -0.10), Letter sets (β = -0.11), RPM (β = -0.12) People with growth mindset do not achieve more. (Bahník and Vranka 2017) using university applicants who took an exam on scholastic aptitude (N = 5653) finds that growth mind-set was not positively associated with results of the test, did not predict change of the results for those who retook the test, did not predict participation in a future administration of the test, nor could it predict the total number of tests taken. (Sisk et al. 2018), finds only a small correlation between mind-set and academic achievement (r = 0.1 and r=.08). (Li and Bates 2020) find no association between growth mind-set and academic achievement. Growth mindset does not improve resilience- if anything, it is negatively associated with resilience. Li and Bates 2019; (Burgoyne, Hambrick, and Macnamara 2020)\n\n\n7.3.4 Grit\nGrit, formulated by Angela Duckworth, is perseverance and passion for long-term goals. (Duckworth et al. 2007, 1087–88) Grit seems to be extremely similar to the Big 5 trait, “conscientiousness”. The two traits correlate at = .66 to .84 (Crede, Tynan, and Harms 2016). This correlation is so high that it indicates that there is little, if anything, new about grit at all. It is probably just a repackaged version of conscientiousness. A growing body of research studies shows that grit has no unique properties compared to more established non-cognitive variables (e.g., (Dixson et al. 2016); (Usher et al. 2019)). Grit also does not seem like it can be grown. Rimfeld et al. (2016) finds that grit was substantially heritable, but found no evidence for a shared environmental influence on grit. Rimfeld et al. (2016) p. 786 explained that “[t]he most limiting finding, for any possible intervention, is that shared environmental influence is negligible”. Regardless, intelligence contributes 48-90 times more than grit and has a negligible effect on educational and economic success (Zisman and Ganzach 2021). Crede, Tynan, and Harms (2016) p.501 conducted a meta-analysis investigating the influence of grit and other traits on academic achievement, and found that while conscientiousness explained variance in academic achievement after controlling for grit, “overall grit explains no variance in either overall academic performance or high school GPA after controlling for conscientiousness”"

    "text": "7.1 Don’t we have multiple intelligences?\nThe theory of multiple intelligences proposes the differentiation of human intelligence into specific intelligences, rather than defining intelligence as a single, general ability. (Gardner 2011)\nGardner, the creator of the theory of multiple intelligences states that “I readily admit that the theory [of multiple intelligences] is no longer current. Several fields of knowledge have advanced significantly since the early 1980s. Any reinvigoration of the theory would require a survey similar to the one that colleagues and I carried out thirty-five years ago.” (Gardner 2016, 169–70). Hunt (2010) p. 119, stated that “there is virtually no objective evidence for the theory” of multiple intelligences. Gardner believes that those who espose general intelligence are “bad guys”. (Gardner 2009) Gardner seems to have called the abilities in his model, “intelligences” in order to “replace the current, [allegedly] largely discredited notion of intelligence as a single inherited trait” (Gardner 2011, 300).\nBy including physical abilities (in bodily-kinesthetic intelligence), personality traits (in interpersonal intelligence) and other non-cognitive traits, Gardner has stretched the word “intelligence” so much that it ceases to have any real meaning (Hunt 2010);(Jensen 1998);(Scarr 1985). Gardner sees g as being a narrow concept that encourages “a limited view of intelligence” (Karoli et al. 2002), but believing in the existence of g does not preclude the existence of other abilities. In fact, both the currently accepted model of intelligence, the Cattell-Horn-Carroll model and bifactor models explicitly recognize the existence of non-g cognitive abilities\nIn order to make the theory of Multiple Intelligences, Gardner habitually cherry picks evidence in his favor and ignores evidence that contradicts his theory (Bouchard Jr 1984); (Messick 1992); (Scarr 1985); (Snow 1985). Frames of Mind also has the drawback of relying heavily on anecdotal data rather than any large, representative sample of individuals performing tasks grounded in his intelligences (Lubinski and Benbow 1995).\nGardner’s theory is also unfalsifiable. Gardener states that he has “never felt that MI theory was one that could be subjected to an ‘up and down’ kind of test, or even series of tests” (Gardner 2011, xix). And that he “[does] not believe that educational programs created under the aegis of MI theory lend themselves to the kinds of randomized control studies that the US government is now calling for in education” (Gardner 2011, xxi). Gardner has stated that he does not endorse any psychological test to measure the multiple intelligences (Karoli et al. 2002)."

    "section": "7.4 What about mutualism?",
    "text": "7.4 What about mutualism?\nMutualism, which states that “cognitive processes are initially uncorrelated, but that the positive manifold arises during individual development due to mutual beneficial relations between cognitive processes.”, has no good empirical backing. Mutualism expects that “it takes some time for the positive manifold, and thus the psychometric g factor, to emerge”, (Van der Maas et al. 2006, 851) but conversely, the proportion of variance in scale scores accounted for by a general factor is stable from age 2.5-90 (Gignac 2014); Thompson, Plomin, and DeFries (1985) even finds evidence for a genetic ‘g’ among infants. Mutualism would expect low genetic correlations among cognitive domains, however, more g-loaded tests are more heritable than the less g-loaded tests (and this exists in non humans as well). This is incredibly problematic. For example, in children, “correlations between phenotypic g loadings and genetic g loadings were 0.88 and 0.76 for the two mental test batteries.” (Deary, Spinath, and Bates 2006) Additionally, “the effect of being raised in the same family is smaller than the effect of genes.” (Second Law of Behavioral Genetics) Mutualism fails to pass lex parsimoniae, is not generalisable, is not falsifiable, and is based mostly on post-hoc justifications (Gignac 2016). Finally, under mutualism, we would expect changes to ‘g’ occurring after social changes and environmental impacts. However, IQ gains from adoption are not g-loaded, (te Nijenhuis, Jongeneel-Grimen, and Armstrong 2015) IQ changes with education are not g-loaded (te Nijenhuis, Jongeneel-Grimen, and Kirkegaard 2014); (Ritchie, Bates, and Deary 2015), etc.\n\n\n\n\nAllik, Jüri, and Anu Realo. 2017. “How Valid Are Culture-Level Mean Personality Scores?” In, 193–224.

    "text": "6.1 Are positive intercorrelations from test design?\nThere are many cognitive batteries that specifically do not try to look for ‘g’, some of which expressly try to avoid it.\n\nResearchers for the British Ability Scales lament that “there is little evidence that strong primary factors… have accounted for any substantial proportion of the common variance of the British Ability Scales. This is despite the fact that the scales sample a wide range of psychological functions.” It asks What, then, are we to make of the results of these analyses? Do they mean that we are back to square one, as it were, and that after 60 years of research we have turned full circle and are back with the theories of Spearman?” (Elliott 1986).\nThe CAS Battery is based on the Soviet inspired PASS theory which disavows g and asserts that intelligence consists of four processes called Planning, Attention-Arousal, Simultaneous, and Successive. The CAS was designed to assess these four processes. However, (Keith, Kranzler, and Flanagan 2001) did a joint confirmatory factor analysis of the CAS together with the WJ-III battery, concluding that not only does the CAS not measure the constructs it was designed to measure, but that notwithstanding the test makers’ aversion to g, the g factor derived from the CAS is large and statistically indistinguishable from the g factor of the WJ-III. The CAS therefore appears to be the opposite of what it was supposed to be: an excellent test of the “non-existent” g and a poor test of the supposedly real non-g abilities it was painstakingly designed to measure.\nThe triarchic theory of intelligence originated as an alternative to the concept of general intelligence factor, or g. (Vinney 2021); (Brody 2003a), (Brody 2003b) analyzed Sternbergs work and finds a general factor of intelligence. Additionally, with tests that are radically different, Confirmatory Factor Analysis showed that different cognitive batteries (CAB, Hawaii Battery, WAIS) were analyzed, and it turned out that the g factors computed from the three tests (five tests in (Johnson, Nijenhuis, and Bouchard 2008)) were statistically indistinguishable from one another, despite the fact that the tests tapped into partly different sets of abilities. (Johnson et al. 2004), (Johnson, Nijenhuis, and Bouchard 2008).\n\nThe significance of this “positive manifold” is that we would not expect someone who is good at one cognitive test to just be good at all of them."

    "section": "6.2 Other evidence for g",
    "text": "6.2 Other evidence for g\n\n6.2.1 Jensen effects\nPractical validity: General intelligence is a good predictor of several seemingly unrelated life outcomes. For example, IQ is the best single predictor of academic and job performance and attainment, and one of the best predictors of a plethora of other outcomes, from income, welfare dependency, and criminality (Gottfredson 1997) to health and mortality and scientific and literary creativity (Robertson et al. 2010), and any number of other things, including even investing success (Grinblatt, Keloharju, and Linnainmaa 2012). If you had to predict the life outcomes of a teenager based on only one fact about them, nothing would be nearly as informative as their IQ.\nOne interesting thing about the predictive validity of a cognitive test is that it is directly related to the test’s g loading. The higher the g loading, the better the validity. In fact, although the g factor generally accounts for less than half of all the variance in a given IQ battery, a lot of research indicates that it accounts for almost all of the predictive validity. The best evidence here are from several large-scale studies of US Air Force personnel. These studies contrasted g and a number of more specific abilities as predictors of performance in Air Force training (Malcom James Ree and Earles 1991) and jobs (Malcolm James Ree, Earles, and Teachout 1994). The results indicated that g is the best predictor of training and job performance across all specialties, and that specific ability tests tailored for each specialty provide little or no incremental validity over g. Thus if you wanted to predict someone’s performance in training or a job, it would be much more useful for you to get their general mental ability score rather than scores on any specific ability tests that are closely matched to the task at hand. This appears to be true in all jobs (Schmidt and Hunter 1998); (Schmidt and Hunter 2004), although specific ability scores may provide substantial incremental validity in the case of high-IQ individuals (Robertson et al. 2010), which is in accord with Charles Spearman’s view that abilities become more differentiated at higher levels of g. (This is why it makes sense for selective colleges to use admission tests that assess different abilities.)\nFor more evidence of how general the predictive validity of g is, we can look at the validity of g as a predictor of performance in GCSEs (General Certificate of Secondary Education), which are academic qualifications awarded in different school subjects at age 14 to 16 in the United Kingdom. (Deary et al. 2007) conducted a prospective study with a very large sample where g was measured at age 11 and GCSEs were obtained about five years later. The g scores correlated positively and substantially with the results of all 25 GCSEs, explaining (to give some examples) about 59 percent of individual differences in math, about 40 to 50 percent in English and foreign languages, and, at the low end, about 18 percent in Art and Design. In contrast, verbal ability, independently of g, explained an average of only 2.2 percent (range 0.0-7.2%) of the results in the 25 exams.\nArthur Jensen referred to g as the “active ingredient” of IQ tests, because g accounts for most if not all of the predictive validity of IQ even though most variance in IQ tests is not g variance. From the perspective of predictive validity, non-g variance seems to be generally just noise. In other words, if you statistically remove g variance from IQ test results, what is left is almost useless for the purposes of predicting behavior (except among high-IQ individuals, as noted above). This is a very surprising finding if one thinks that different mental abilities are actually independent, and g is just an uninteresting statistical artifact caused by an occasional recruitment of many uncorrelated abilities for the same task.\nHollowness of IQ training effects\nAnother interesting fact about g is that there is there is a systematic relation between g loadings and practice effects in IQ tests. A meta-analysis of re-testing effects on IQ scores showed that there is a perfect negative correlation between score gains and g loadings of tests (te Nijenhuis, van Vianen, and van der Flier 2007). It appears that specific abilities are trainable but g is generally not (see also Arendasy and Sommer (2013)). Similarly, a recent meta-analysis of the effects of working memory training on intelligence showed, in line with many earlier reviews, that cognitive training produces short-term gains in the specific abilities trained, but no “far transfer” to any other abilities (Melby-Lervåg and Hulme 2013). Jensen called such gains hollow because they do not seem to represent actual improvements in real-world intellectual performance. These findings are consistent with the view that g is a “central processing unit” that cannot be defined in terms of specific abilities and is not affected by changes in those abilities.\n\n\n6.2.2 Quantitative genetic correlates\nOn a biological level, cognitive abilities are heritable. (Polderman et al. 2015) Higher g-loadings correlate to higher heritabilities (Jensen 1987),(J. P. Rushton et al. 2007), (Van Bloois et al. 2009),(te Nijenhuis, Kura, and Hur 2014). Quantitative genetic analyses indicate that g is an even stronger genetic variable than it is a phenotypic variable. (Plomin and Spinath 2004) states,\n“Multivariate genetic analysis yields a statistic called genetic correlation, which is an index of the extent to which genetic effects on one trait correlate with genetic effects on another trait independent of the heritability of the two traits. That is, two traits could be highly heritable but the genetic correlation between them could be zero. Conversely, two traits could be only modestly heritable but the genetic correlation between them could be 1.0, indicating that even though genetic effects are not strong (because heritability is modest) the same genetic effects are involved in both traits. In the case of specific cognitive abilities that are moderately heritable, multivariate genetic analyses have consistently found that genetic correlations are very high—close to 1.0 (Petrill 1997). That is, although Spearman’s g is a phenotypic construct, g is even stronger genetically. These multivariate genetic results predict that when genes are found that are associated with one cognitive ability, such as spatial ability, they will also be associated just as strongly with other cognitive abilities, such as verbal ability or memory. Conversely, attempts to find genes for specific cognitive abilities independent of general cognitive ability are unlikely to succeed because what is in common among cognitive abilities is largely genetic and what is independent is largely environmental.”\n\n\n6.2.3 Neurobiological correlates\nThe controversy if brain anatomy correlates with intelligence has existed for decades but since the 1980s some neuroscientists have worked to bridge the gap between these two fields, and in the twenty-first century their evidence and theories support the belief that g does indeed have connections to brain anatomy and functioning twenty-first century their evidence and theories support the belief that g does indeed have connections to brain anatomy and functioning (Haier 2017).\nBrain Volume\nThere are brain characteristics that do correlate with IQ scores. One of the best known is the correlation between brain size and intelligence, which when measured via brain-imaging techniques in living individuals is between r = .20 and .40. Other measures of brain size (e.g., data from autopsies, or measures of head circumference) have weaker, though positive, correlations (Cox et al. 2019); (Gignac and Bates 2017); (Lee et al. 2019); (Pietschnig et al. 2015); (J. Rushton and Ankney 2009). A 2022 meta-analysis ultimately states that most reasonable estimates for the brain size and IQ link yield r-values in the mid-0.20s, with the most extreme specifications yielding rs of 0.10 and 0.37. (Pietschnig et al. 2022). Additionally, measures of the size of the whole brain are more strongly correlated than measures of specific brain regions. It is important, though, to note that the size of the frontal lobes seems more strongly correlated with IQ than other regions of the brain (Cox et al. 2019); (Flashman et al. 1997).\nThere seems to be some sort of association with g since better measures of g produce stronger correlations with brain size (Gignac and Bates 2017), (Pietschnig et al. 2022). The relationship between brain volume and IQ is clearly complex and seems to be modestly moderated by g. (Woodley of Menie et al. 2016)\nOther Brain Characteristics\nSince the 1990s, neuroscientists have discovered more variables correlated with IQ. For example, research has shown the importance of the white matter in the brain, which is the tissue that connects brain regions to one another. Volume of white matter is correlated with speed of problem solving (Penke et al. 2012) and with IQ, thus showing that connectivity of brain regions is likely to be an important determinant of intelligence levels (Haier 2017); (Kievit et al. 2016). Likewise, grey matter (where the neuron cell bodies are found) is important; loss of neurons due to disease is associated with decreases in IQ (Veluw et al. 2012). Additionally, smarter people have more neurons in their brains, and those neurons are more densely packed together (Genç et al. 2018). Another intriguing recent finding is that neurons are better organized in high-IQ ndividuals’ brains than in the brains of people who score poorly on intelligence tests.\n\n\n\n\nArendasy, Martin E., and Markus Sommer. 2013. “Quantitative Differences in Retest Effects Across Different Methods Used to Construct Alternate Test Forms.” Intelligence 41 (3): 181–92. https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2013.02.004.\n\n\nBrody, Nathan. 2003a. “Construct Validation of the Sternberg Triarchic Abilities Test: Comment and Reanalysis.” Intelligence 31 (4): 319–29. https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/S0160-2896(01)00087-3.\n\n\n———. 2003b. “What Sternberg Should Have Concluded.” Intelligence 31 (4): 339–42. https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/S0160-2896(02)00190-3.\n\n\nCox, S.

For example, individuals who perform well on one cognitive task, such as verbal ability, tend to perform well on other cognitive tasks, such as spatial ability, indicating a positive correlation between various cognitive abilities.\nMoreover, the g factor has been found to predict a range of important life outcomes, such as academic and job performance, income level, and even health outcomes.

    "text": "The CHC model\nThe Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory of intelligence is a prominent model that attempts to explain the structure of cognitive abilities. The theory proposes that intelligence is composed of a hierarchical structure of three strata: the general factor (g factor), broad abilities, and narrow abilities.\n\n\n\nCattell–Horn–Carroll theory of intelligence\n\n\nAt the top of the hierarchy is the g factor, which represents a general factor of intelligence that is common to all cognitive tasks. The broad abilities, located in the middle stratum, are a group of abilities that are less general than the g factor but still encompass a range of related cognitive tasks. Examples of broad abilities include fluid reasoning, crystallized intelligence, processing speed, and working memory. Finally, the narrow abilities, located at the bottom stratum, are specific abilities that are highly specialized and task-specific.\nThe CHC theory supports the existence of the g factor by showing that performance on different cognitive tasks is highly correlated, indicating a common underlying factor that influences performance across tasks. In addition, factor analyses of a wide range of intelligence tests consistently reveal a strong first factor that represents the g factor.\nMoreover, the CHC theory provides a framework for understanding the relationships between the g factor and other cognitive abilities. For example, fluid reasoning is considered a broad ability that is strongly related to the g factor and is involved in abstract thinking and problem-solving. Crystallized intelligence, on the other hand, is a broad ability that represents the application of knowledge and skills acquired through experience and education and is less strongly related to the g factor.\nBecause it has an impressive body of empirical support in the research literature (e.g., developmental, neurocognitive, outcome‐criterion), this model of intelligence is the one that psychologists predominantly use. It is used extensively as the foundation for selecting, organizing, and interpreting tests of intelligence and cognitive abilities. (Alfonso et al. 2005);(Beal 2006);(McGrew et al. 2005);(Schneider et al. 2012) Additionally, this model is the most comprehensive and empirically supported psychometric theory of the structure of cognitive abilities to date. (Flanagan and Dixon 2014)\nCHC is the best model from exploratory factor analysis (J. B. Carroll, B, and Press 1993) and is confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis (Gustafsson 1984); (J. Carroll 2003) (Jewsbury, Bowden, and Duff 2017). Confirmatory factor analysis showed that purposely different IQ batteries (CAB, Hawaii Battery, WAIS, etc) were analyzed, and it turned out that the g factors computed from the respective tests were statistically indistinguishable from one another, despite the fact that the tests tapped into partly different sets of abilities.

    "text": "Neurobiological theories\nThe leading neurobiological theory for intelligence is called the Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory (P-FIT). It has been described as “the best available answer to the question of where in the brain intelligence resides” (Deary and Penke 2010)\n\n\n\nA schematic showing the P-FIT model. The circles correspond to brain regions that are often functionally important for solving tasks related to g and abstract reasoning. Dark circles are areas that are usually in the left hemisphere of the brain, while light circles are usually in the right hemisphere. The numbers correspond to Brodmann areas, which is a standardized system of mapping regions of the brain. The double-headed arrow corresponds to the arcuate fasciculus, a white matter structure that connects many of these brain regions. Source: (Jung and Haier 2007, 138)\n\n\nAbove is a visual representation of P-FIT. In this model, there are several brain regions, mostly located in the frontal lobe (towards the front of the brain) and the parietal lobe (on the top part of the brain, somewhat towards the rear), that are connected with a white matter tract called the arcuate fasciculus. According to the P-FIT model’s creators, g arises from both how well these areas function and how well they are connected to one another in the brain (Jung and Haier 2007). This explains two initial hurdles to understanding how g relates to the brain. The first is why there is no one area in the brain that is activated when a person engages in reasoning tasks. The second hurdle is why several previous studies had suggested that the size and use of multiple areas in the parietal and frontal lobes were correlated with IQ.\nEuler (2018) has recently proposed another theory of how the brain generates g. Rather than focusing on specific brain regions, Euler has built on the predictive processing theory of brain functioning, which posits that the brain is a “prediction machine” that is adapted to help an organism form expectations about the environment and to give attention to events that violate those expectations (e.g., the presence of a danger in a location that the person thought was safe). Euler believes that intelligence may be the manifestation of the brain’s ability to handle unexpected situations and that more intelligent people are better able to manage unexpected events than people with less intelligence. This theory would explain why intelligence differences are more apparent in more complex tasks. Other characteristics of intelligence that predictive processing theory could explain are the positive manifold, why cognitive abilities may form a hierarchy (like in the Cattell–Horn–Carroll model), and why so many different tasks can measure g.\nThis is just a hint at the non-neurological data that support predictive processing theory, and it has the potential to serve as a bridge between the neurology of brain functioning and manifestations of intelligence in people’s behavior. Readers should recognize that predictive processing and P-FIT are not necessarily contradictory. Predictive processing is based mostly on research about brain functioning, while P-FIT is based mostly on brain-imaging data about the size and performance of larger brain regions. It is possible that both theories are correct and that predictive processing explains how the brain generates intelligent behavior while using the regions highlighted in the P-FIT model.\n\n\n\n\nAlfonso, V.
