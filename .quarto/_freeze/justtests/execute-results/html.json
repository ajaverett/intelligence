Research has consistently shown that virtually every cognitive battery is highly g-loaded, meaning that the tasks on these tests share a common factor of general intelligence. In other words, individuals who perform well on one cognitive task are likely to perform well on other cognitive tasks, indicating a positive correlation between various cognitive abilities. \n\nThe high g-loading of intelligence tests indicates that these tests are measuring a broad and general factor of intelligence that is common to all cognitive tasks. The g factor is not limited to specific abilities, such as memory or verbal fluency, but rather represents a general cognitive ability that influences performance across a range of tasks. Therefore, it is reasonable to argue that intelligence tests measure intelligence, specifically, the g factor.\n\nWhile intelligence tests may not perfectly measure intelligence and may not capture 100 percent of the variance of cognitive ability, empirical evidence supports their validity and reliability as measures of general intelligence. [@vandermaas2014]\n\n## The Positive Manifold \nThe positive manifold refers to the observation that all intelligence subtests, including scholastic and social intelligence tests, correlate positively. This pattern indicates that intelligence can be measured as a composite score derived from various cognitive abilities. \n\nThe consistency of this positive correlation, known as the g factor, has been observed even in tests initially designed to measure other traits or abilities. Since it is so easy for cognitive batteries to measure intelligence, some tests that were created with the intention of measuring more narrow abilities end up unintentionally measuring the g-factor. For example, the Cognitive Assessment System (CAS) and the Cognitive Abilities Measurement (CAM) battery were both designed to measure cognitive processes – not g, but they still measure g anyway [@keith2001]; [@stauffer1996]. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that different cognitive batteries (CAB, Hawaii Battery, WAIS) were analyzed, and it turned out that the g factors computed from the three tests (five tests in Johnson 2008) were statistically indistinguishable from one another, despite the fact that the tests tapped into partly different sets of abilities [@johnson2004]; [@johnson2008]. \n\n## Are intelligence tests statistically valid?\n\nIntelligence tests are among the most reliable and valid psychological tests and assessments and as such, they are used extensively in educational, organizational, and clinical settings [@detterman2014]. \n\nAccording to the Wikipedia page on IQ:\n\n\n```{Wikipedia}\nThere are a variety of individually administered IQ tests in use in the English-speaking world. The most commonly used individual IQ test series is the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) for adults and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) for school-age test-takers. Other commonly used individual IQ tests (some of which do not label their standard scores as \"IQ\" scores) include the current versions of the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales, Woodcock–Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities, the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, the Cognitive Assessment System, and the Differential Ability Scales.\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n- Concurrent validity: Intelligence tests, such as the WCJIV, FSIQ, WAIS, and WBIS, show high correlations with one another. [@canivez2017]\n- External validity: Genetic studies have identified specific genetic variances associated with neurodevelopment and brain functioning, which are also linked to interindividual differences in intelligence and/or educational attainment. Furthermore, brighter individuals tend to have larger, healthier, and more organized brains.\n- Predictive validity: Despite not being designed to correlate with real-world behavior, intelligence tests are some of the best predictors of educational, occupational, and financial attainment.\n- Construct validity: Intelligence tests like the WAIS-IV, WJ-III, and SB-V are all considered construct valid.\n- Test-retest reliability: IQ scores demonstrate moderate to strong correlations, suggesting stability from the age of six onwards.\n- Split-half reliability: Most intelligence tests have a reliability coefficient of 0.97 or higher, indicating very good reliability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Van der Maas (2014) explains that intelligence is (seriously) what the intelligence test measures.\n\n## Are intelligence tests statistically valid?\n\nMillions of intelligence tests are given in educational and organizational settings and also serve as clinical tools. Intelligence tests are among the most reliable and valid of all psychological tests and assessments. Detterman (2014) Intelligence tests are sound in terms of both validity and reliability.\n\nConcurrent validity: The WCJIV correlated with FSIQ, WAIS, WBIS, among other tests all at 0.7 or higher. (Canivez 2017) The FSIQ correlated with WAIS, SBIV, WJIII etc at 0.78 or higher. (Janzen et al, 2004). External validity: Geneticists have identified specific genetic variances correlated with neurodevelopment and brain functioning that are arises from a distributed network of well-connected brain regions, mostly located in the parietal and frontal lobes (Deary et al., 2010; Haier, 2017; Jung & Haier, 2007; Penke et al., 2012). In turn, these regions—and the brain as a whole—seem to be larger, healthier, and more organized in brighter people (Flashman et al., 1997; Genç et al., 2018; Gignac & Bates, 2017; W. D. Hill et al., 2019). Geneticists have identified specific genetic variances correlated with neurodevelopment and brain functioning that are also associated with interindividual differences in intelligence and/or educational attainment (e.g., Adams et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2018; Okbay et al., 2016). Predictive Validity: Even though Intelligence tests are not designed to correlate with any real world behavior, they end up being some the best predictors for educational, occupational, and financial attainment. IQ scores highly predict the dispositional capabilities of people. (Strenze 2007, 2015; Kaufman 2009) Construct Validity: The WAIS-IV, WJ-III, and SB-V all are construct valid. (Wechsler, 2008; Janzen et al, 2004 Woodcock et al, 2001) Using neuroscientific  Test-retest reliability: First, from 6 years old onward, correlations among IQ scores range from moderately strong to strong, suggesting that IQ scores are relatively stable once children reach school age (Deary, 2014; Hunt, 2010; Sternberg, Grigorenko, & Bundy, 2001). Ye et al, 2018 records the use confirmatory factor analysis at different developmental stages to confirm the stability of intelligence throughout adulthood. Split-half reliability: Abad, Quiroga, and Colom (2017) records that the reliability coefficient of most intelligence tests is 0.97 or higher. For context, “if the reliability of a standardized test is above .80, it is said to have very good reliability” \n\n",
