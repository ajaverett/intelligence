abstract = {Models of the structure of cognitive abilities suggested by Spearman, Thurstone, Guilford, Vernon and Cattell-Horn are reviewed. It is noted that some of the models include a general intellectual factor (g) while others do not. It is also noted that some models are nonhierarchical, while in others more narrow abilities are subsumed under broader abilities in a hierarchical pattern. An empirical study in which a test battery of 16 tests was administered to some 1000 subjects in the 6th grade is reported. Using the LISREL technique to test different models, good support is obtained for oblique primary factors in the Thurstone tradition as well as for the second-order factors fluid intelligence, crystallized intelligence, and general visualization hypothesized by Cattell and Horn. It is also found, however, that the second-order factor of fluid intelligence i is identical with a third-order g-factor. On the basis of these results a three-level model (the HILI-model) is suggested, with the g-factor at the top, two broad factors reflecting the ability to deal with verbal and figural information, respectively, at the second-order level, and the primary factors in the Thurstone and Guilford tradition at the lowest level. It is argued that most previously suggested models are special cases of the HILI-model.}

    abstract = { The Cattell–Horn–Carroll (CHC) model is a comprehensive model of the major dimensions of individual differences that underlie performance on cognitive tests. Studies evaluating the generality of the CHC model across test batteries, age, gender, and culture were reviewed and found to be overwhelmingly supportive. However, less research is available to evaluate the CHC model for clinical assessment. The CHC model was shown to provide good to excellent fit in nine high-quality data sets involving popular neuropsychological tests, across a range of clinically relevant populations. Executive function tests were found to be well represented by the CHC constructs, and a discrete executive function factor was found not to be necessary. The CHC model could not be simplified without significant loss of fit. The CHC model was supported as a paradigm for cognitive assessment, across both healthy and clinical populations and across both nonclinical and neuropsychological tests. The results have important implications for theoretical modeling of cognitive abilities, providing further evidence for the value of the CHC model as a basis for a common taxonomy across test batteries and across areas of assessment. }

abstract = {The concept of a general intelligence factor or g is controversial in psychology. Although the controversy swirls at many levels, one of the most important involves g's identification and measurement in a group of individuals. If g is actually predictive of a range of intellectual performances, the factor identified in one battery of mental ability tests should be closely related to that identified in another dissimilar aggregation of abilities. We addressed the extent to which this prediction was true using three mental ability batteries administered to a heterogeneous sample of 436 adults. Though the particular tasks used in the batteries reflected varying conceptions of the range of human intellectual performance, the g factors identified by the batteries were completely correlated (correlations were .99, .99, and 1.00). This provides further evidence for the existence of a higher-level g factor and suggests that its measurement is not dependent on the use of specific mental ability tasks.}

abstract = {In a recent paper, Johnson, Bouchard, Krueger, McGue, and Gottesman (2004) addressed a long-standing debate in psychology by demonstrating that the g factors derived from three test batteries administered to a single group of individuals were completely correlated. This finding provided evidence for the existence of a unitary higher-level general intelligence construct whose measurement is not dependent on the specific abilities assessed. In the current study we constructively replicated this finding utilizing five test batteries. The replication is important because there were substantial differences in both the sample and the batteries administered from those in the original study. The current sample consisted of 500 Dutch seamen of very similar age and somewhat truncated range of ability. The batteries they completed included many tests of perceptual ability and dexterity, and few verbally oriented tests. With the exception of the g correlations involving the Cattell Culture Fair Test, which consists of just four matrix reasoning tasks of very similar methodology, all of the g correlations were at least .95. The lowest g correlation was .77. We discuss the implications of this finding.}

abstract="Cultural bias in mental testing has been a recurring issue since the beginning of the testing movement itself. From Binet to Jensen, many professionals have addressed the problem, with varying and inconsistent outcomes. Unlike the pervasive and polemical nature-nurture argument, the bias issue has been until recently largely restricted to the professional literature, except for a few early discussions in the popular press (e.g., Freeman, 1923; Lippmann, 1923a,b). Of some interest is the fact that one of the psychologists who initially raised the question was the then-young Cyril Burt (1921), who even in the 1920s was concerned about the extent to which environmental and motivational factors affect performance on intelligence tests. Within the last few years, however, the question of cultural test bias has burst forth as a major contemporary problem far beyond the bounds of scholarly academic debate in psychology. For approximately the last decade, the debate over bias has raged in both the professional and the popular press (e.g., Fine, 1975). Entangled in the larger issues of individual liberties, civil rights, and social justice, the bias issue has become a focal point for psychologists, sociologists, politicians, and the public. Increasingly, the issue has become a political and legal one, as reflected in numerous court cases and passage in the state of New York and consideration elsewhere of ``truth-in-testing'' legislation.",

abstract = {The current study examines the views of experts in the science of mental abilities about the primacy and uniqueness of g and the social implications of ability testing, and compares their responses to the views of a group of non-expert psychologists. Results indicate expert consensus that g is an important, non-trivial determinant (or at least predictor) of important real world outcomes for which there is no substitute, and that tests of g are valid and generally free from racial bias. Experts did not reach consensus on issues such as the degree to which specific abilities or combinations of non-cognitive traits can yield predictive validities comparable to that of g alone, the predictive validity of g for non-technical work outcomes (e.g., contextual performance), and the nature and implications of race differences in intelligence. Second, a comparison of responses from experts and a group of applied psychologists reveals several discrepant beliefs between these groups, primarily dealing with the primacy of g, susceptibility of ability tests to racial bias, and the potential value of ability testing. Results are discussed in terms of directions for future research and shared responsibility for various groups of researchers to enhance dissemination of research to relevant audiences.}

The evidence indicates that McGurk's results cannot be explained in terms of item biases, but appear to be the result of the noncultural items requiring more sheer reasoning ability than the cultural items, which depend more on acquired information.}

In this meta-analysis we estimated the effects of stereotype threat on performance of girls on math, science and spatial skills (MSSS) tests. Moreover, we studied publication bias and four moderators: test difficulty, presence of boys, gender equality within countries, and the type of control group that was used in the studies. We selected study samples when the study included girls, samples had a mean age below 18years, the design was (quasi-)experimental, the stereotype threat manipulation was administered between-subjects, and the dependent variable was a MSSS test related to a gender stereotype favoring boys. To analyze the 47 effect sizes, we used random effects and mixed effects models. The estimated mean effect size equaled −0.22 and significantly differed from 0. None of the moderator variables was significant; however, there were several signs for the presence of publication bias. We conclude that publication bias might seriously distort the literature on the effects of stereotype threat among schoolgirls. We propose a large replication study to provide a less biased effect size estimate.}

    abstract = { Objective:The objective of this study was to characterize racial-ethnic variation in diagnoses and treatment of mental disorders in large not-for-profit health care systems.Methods:Participating systems were 11 private, not-for-profit health care organizations constituting the Mental Health Research Network, with a combined 7,523,956 patients age 18 or older who received care during 2011. Rates of diagnoses, prescription of psychotropic medications, and total formal psychotherapy sessions received were obtained from insurance claims and electronic medical record databases across all health care settings.Results:Of the 7.5 million patients in the study, 1.2 million (15.6\%) received a psychiatric diagnosis in 2011. This varied significantly by race-ethnicity, with Native American/Alaskan Native patients having the highest rates of any diagnosis (20.6\%) and Asians having the lowest rates (7.5\%). Among patients with a psychiatric diagnosis, 73\% (N=850,585) received a psychotropic medication. Non-Hispanic white patients were significantly more likely (77.8\%) than other racial-ethnic groups (odds ratio [OR] range .48–.81) to receive medication. In contrast, only 34\% of patients with a psychiatric diagnosis (N=548,837) received formal psychotherapy. Racial-ethnic differences were most pronounced for depression and schizophrenia; compared with whites, non-Hispanic blacks were more likely to receive formal psychotherapy for their depression (OR=1.20) or for their schizophrenia (OR=2.64).Conclusions:There were significant racial-ethnic differences in diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric conditions across 11 U.S. health care systems. Further study is needed to understand underlying causes of these observed differences and whether processes and outcomes of care are equitable across these diverse patient populations. }

Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts et al. describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aac4716 A large-scale assessment suggests that experimental reproducibility in psychology leaves a lot to be desired. Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.}}

This chapter stresses that Arthur Jensen has amply validated the conjecture that there is a general factor of intelligence, and examines the general factor of intelligence. The major problem confronting intelligence research is the focus on individual differences—both conceptually and methodologically. Therefore, the chapter proposes an alternative componential analysis to analyze performance on test items of the kinds found on intelligence tests through information-processing components rather than psychometric factors. Each component corresponds to one of the constituents underlying general cognitive ability, g. The ultimate goal is to identify all such components underlying the general factor, as well as group and possibly even specific factors. The chapter suggests that underlying the solution of analogies and related problems are three qualitative principles of cognition, which are explained in the chapter. The data from research points out that information-processing techniques can be used to rediscover g.}

The survey was conducted in 2013 and 2014 using the Internet-based Expert Questionnaire on Cognitive Ability (EQCA). In the current study, we examined the background of the experts (e.g., nationality, gender, religion, and political orientation) and their positions on intelligence research, controversial issues, and the media. Most experts were male (83%) and from Western countries (90%). Political affiliations ranged from the left (liberal, 54%) to the right (conservative, 24%), with more extreme responses within the left-liberal spectrum. Experts rated the media and public debates as far below adequate. Experts with a left (liberal, progressive) political orientation were more likely to have positive views of the media (around r = |.30|). In contrast, compared to female and left (liberal) experts, male and right (conservative) experts were more likely to endorse the validity of IQ testing (correlations with gender, politics: r = .55, .41), the g factor theory of intelligence (r = .18, .34), and the impact of genes on US Black-White differences (r = .50, .48). The paper compares the results to those of prior expert surveys and discusses the role of experts' backgrounds, with a focus on political orientation and gender. An underrepresentation of viewpoints associated with experts' background characteristics (i.e., political views, gender) may distort research findings and should be addressed in higher education policy.}

Many have been entrusted with obligations and resources for making critical decisions about individual and organizational well-being. Their leadership positions in business, health care, law, the professoriate, and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) suggest that many are outstanding creators of modern culture, constituting a precious human-capital resource.

Duke University’s Talent Identification Program (TIP) identified 259 young adolescents who were equally gifted. By age 40, their life accomplishments also were extraordinary: Thirty-seven percent had earned doctorates, 7.5\% had achieved academic tenure (4.3\% at research-intensive universities), and 9\% held patents; many were high-level leaders in major organizations. As was the case for the SMPY sample before them, differential ability strengths predicted their contrasting and eventual developmental trajectories—even though essentially all participants possessed both mathematical and verbal reasoning abilities far superior to those of typical Ph.D. recipients. Individuals, even profoundly gifted ones, primarily do what they are best at. Differences in ability patterns, like differences in interests, guide development along different paths, but ability level, coupled with commitment, determines whether and the extent to which noteworthy accomplishments are reached if opportunity presents itself. }

Test scores and GPAs were obtained from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (N=1950) and the College Board Validity Study (N=160670). Regressions estimated linear and quadratic relations among g, based on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery, composite and subtest scores of aptitude tests, and college GPAs. Linear effects explained almost all the variance in relations among variables. In contrast, quadratic effects explained trivial additional variance among variables (less than 1%, on average). The results do not support theories of intelligence (threshold theories or Spearman's Law of Diminishing Returns), which predict that test scores lose predictive power with increases in ability level or at a certain threshold.}

abstract={Intelligence is highly heritable1 and a major determinant of human health and well-being2. Recent genome-wide meta-analyses have identified 24 genomic loci linked to variation in intelligence3--7, but much about its genetic underpinnings remains to be discovered. Here, we present a large-scale genetic association study of intelligence (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}269,867), identifying 205 associated genomic loci (190 new) and 1,016 genes (939 new) via positional mapping, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping, chromatin interaction mapping, and gene-based association analysis. We find enrichment of genetic effects in conserved and coding regions and associations with 146 nonsynonymous exonic variants. Associated genes are strongly expressed in the brain, specifically in striatal medium spiny neurons and hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Gene set analyses implicate pathways related to nervous system development and synaptic structure. We confirm previous strong genetic correlations with multiple health-related outcomes, and Mendelian randomization analysis results suggest protective effects of intelligence for Alzheimer's disease and ADHD and bidirectional causation with pleiotropic effects for schizophrenia. These results are a major step forward in understanding the neurobiology of cognitive function as well as genetically related neurological and psychiatric disorders.},

Data from a validated mental ability test administered to all 1921 born Scottish schoolchildren on June 1, 1932 were transformed into age-adjusted IQs. About 52.1% of those tested were identified as remaining in the region into adult life and 10.4% of these made contact with specialist psychiatric services by age 77. Odds ratios for the risk of psychiatric contact by IQ group were compared. A Cox regression analysis modeled the impact of socioeconomic deprivation, gender, and urban living. Intelligence is shown to be an independent predictor of lifetime psychiatric contact. Each standard deviation decrease in IQ results in a 12% increase in the risk of contact, independent of gender and childhood residence. The number of cases was too small to explore differences in diagnostic groups.}

abstract={Intelligence, or general cognitive function, is phenotypically and genetically correlated with many traits, including a wide range of physical, and mental health variables. Education is strongly genetically correlated with intelligence (rg{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.70). We used these findings as foundations for our use of a novel approach---multi-trait analysis of genome-wide association studies (MTAG; Turley et al. 2017)---to combine two large genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of education and intelligence, increasing statistical power and resulting in the largest GWAS of intelligence yet reported. Our study had four goals: first, to facilitate the discovery of new genetic loci associated with intelligence; second, to add to our understanding of the biology of intelligence differences; third, to examine whether combining genetically correlated traits in this way produces results consistent with the primary phenotype of intelligence; and, finally, to test how well this new meta-analytic data sample on intelligence predicts phenotypic intelligence in an independent sample. By combining datasets using MTAG, our functional sample size increased from 199,242 participants to 248,482. We found 187 independent loci associated with intelligence, implicating 538 genes, using both SNP-based and gene-based GWAS. We found evidence that neurogenesis and myelination---as well as genes expressed in the synapse, and those involved in the regulation of the nervous system---may explain some of the biological differences in intelligence. The results of our combined analysis demonstrated the same pattern of genetic correlations as those from previous GWASs of intelligence, providing support for the meta-analysis of these genetically-related phenotypes.},

	abstract = {Objective Studies reporting that highly intelligent individuals have more mental health disorders often have sampling bias, no or inadequate control group, or insufficient sample size. We addressed these caveats by examining the difference in the prevalence of mental health disorders between individuals with high and average general intelligence (g-factor) in the UK Biobank.Methods Participants with general intelligence (g-factor) scores standardized relative to the same-age UK population, were divided into 2 groups: a high g-factor group (g-factor 2 SD above the UK mean; N=16,137) and an average g-factor group (g-factor within 2 SD of the UK mean; N=236,273). Using self-report questionnaires and medical diagnoses, we examined group differences in prevalence across 32 phenotypes, including mental health disorders, trauma, allergies, and other traits.Results High and average g-factor groups differed across 15/32 phenotypes and did not depend on sex and/or age. Individuals with high g-factors had less general anxiety (OR=0.69) and PTSD (OR=0.67), were less neurotic (β=-0.12), less socially isolated (OR=0.85), and were less likely to have experienced childhood stressors and abuse, adulthood stressors, or catastrophic trauma (OR=0.69-0.90). They did not differ in any other mental health disorder or trait. However, they generally had more allergies (e.g., eczema; OR=1.13-1.33).Conclusions The present study provides robust evidence that highly intelligent individuals have no more mental health disorders than the average population. High intelligence even appears as a protective factor for general anxiety and PTSD.Question Are high IQ individuals at increased risk of mental health disorders?Findings In the UK Biobank (N ≃ 7,266 - 252,249), highly intelligent individuals (2SD above the population mean) were less likely to suffer from general anxiety and PTSD, and no more likely to have depression, social anxiety, a drug use disorder, eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.Meaning Contrary to popular belief, high intelligence is not a risk factor for psychiatric disorders and even serves as a protective factor for general anxiety and PTSD.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work received support under the program Investissements d Avenir launched by the French Government and implemented by l Agence Nationale de la recherche (ANR) with the references ANR-17-EURE-0017 and ANR-10-IDEX-0001-02 PSL.

This relation, however, is moderated by the unit, the source, the range of SES variable, and the type of SES-achievement measure. The relation is also contingent upon school level, minority status, and school location. The author conducted a replica of White's (1982) meta-analysis to see whether the SES-achievement correlation had changed since White's initial review was published.

The results demonstrate that intelligence is a powerful predictor of success but, on the whole, not an overwhelmingly better predictor than parental SES or grades.

(2004) .This commentary touches on practical, public policy, and social science domains informed by cognitive epidemiology while pulling together common themes running through this important special issue. As is made clear in the contributions assembled here, and others (Deary, Whalley, & Starr, 2009; Gottfredson, 2004; Lubinski & Humphreys, 1992, 1997), social scientists and practitioners cannot afford to neglect cognitive ability when modeling epidemiological and health care phenomena. However, given the dominant concern about the confounding of general cognitive ability (GCA) and socioeconomic status (SES), and the extent to which SES is frequently seen as the primary cause of health disparities (while GCA is neglected as a possible influence in epidemiology and health psychology), some methodological applications for untangling the relative influences of GCA and SES are reviewed. In addition, cognitive epidemiology is placed in a broader context: Just as cognitive epidemiology facilitates an understanding of pathology ("at risk" populations, and ways to attenuate undesirable personal and social conditions), it may also enrich our understanding of optimal functioning ("at promise" populations, and ways to identify and nurture the human and social capital needed to develop innovations for saving lives, economies, and perhaps even our planet). Finally, while GCA is likely the most important dimension in the study of individual differences for modeling healthy behaviors and outcomes, other relatively independent dimensions of psychological diversity do add value (Krueger, Caspi, & Moffitt, 2000). For example, compliance has at least two psychological components: a "can do" competency component (ability) and a "will do" motivational component (conscientiousness). Ultimately, developing and modeling healthy behaviors, interpersonal environments, and medical maladies are best accomplished by teaming multiple dimensions of human individuality.

abstract={Although common sense suggests that environmental influences increasingly account for individual differences in behavior as experiences accumulate during the course of life, this hypothesis has not previously been tested, in part because of the large sample sizes needed for an adequately powered analysis. Here we show for general cognitive ability that, to the contrary, genetic influence increases with age. The heritability of general cognitive ability increases significantly and linearly from 41{\%} in childhood (9 years) to 55{\%} in adolescence (12 years) and to 66{\%} in young adulthood (17 years) in a sample of 11{\thinspace}000 pairs of twins from four countries, a larger sample than all previous studies combined. In addition to its far-reaching implications for neuroscience and molecular genetics, this finding suggests new ways of thinking about the interface between nature and nurture during the school years. Why, despite life's `slings and arrows of outrageous fortune', do genetically driven differences increasingly account for differences in general cognitive ability? We suggest that the answer lies with genotype--environment correlation: as children grow up, they increasingly select, modify and even create their own experiences in part based on their genetic propensities.},

abstract = {The key role of the family environment in the development of cognitive ability is well established. However, the nature of the environmental processes involved remains unclear. We sought to determine the role of the rearing environment in cognitive ability after controlling for genetic confounding. Our design included 436 Swedish male–male sibling pairs with differing rearing environments. Using military conscription cognitive assessments, we examined the mean IQ and dispersion of the home-reared and adopted-away siblings as a function of the age difference between siblings at the time of adoption. We replicated these analyses using data on 2,341 Swedish male–male half-sibling pairs. The mean IQ of the adopted-away siblings was significantly higher than that of the home-reared siblings at all ages at which the siblings were separated. The IQs of the home-reared and adopted-away siblings became more similar with increasing age at separation. The adopted-away siblings’ IQs were more variable than those of the home-reared siblings at early ages at separation, but this difference decreased with increasing age at separation. We replicated these results in the half-sibling pairs. In both datasets, the age at separation at which the sibling correlations reached 0.5 approximated 12 y. We conclude that rearing environment has a substantial impact on cognitive ability, even after controlling for genetic confounding. We hypothesize that the family environment affects the malleability of cognitive ability, which, in turn, is a function of the developing brain’s cognitive reserve. The age at which this malleability begins to decrease is around 12 y.}

abstract={Previous reviews of the literature have suggested that shared environmental effects may be underestimated in adoption studies because adopted individuals are exposed to a restricted range of family environments. A sample of 409 adoptive and 208 non-adoptive families from the Sibling Interaction and Behavior Study (SIBS) was used to identify the environmental dimensions on which adoptive families show greatest restriction and to determine the effect of this restriction on estimates of the adoptive sibling correlation. Relative to non-adoptive families, adoptive families experienced a 41{\%} reduction of variance in parent disinhibitory psychopathology and an 18{\%} reduction of variance in socioeconomic status (SES). There was limited evidence for range restriction in exposure to bad peer models, parent depression, or family climate. However, restriction in range in parent disinhibitory psychopathology and family SES had no effect on adoptive-sibling correlations for delinquency, drug use, and IQ. These data support the use of adoption studies to obtain direct estimates of the importance of shared environmental effects on psychological development.},

The first factor, clearly identifiable as g, accounted for about 30 per cent of the variance. The second factor, again clearly identifiable for each age group as verbal recall of pictures, accounted for between 5 and 9 per cent of the variance. The proportion of reliable specific variance was calculated for each scale, and this accounted for about 46 per cent of the variance. Well over half the reliable variance is therefore attributable to specificity. These results indicate higher levels of specificity than in the WPPSI, WISC-R and WAIS. It was concluded that the British Ability Scales have sufficient specificity to justify comparisons between scales in profiles of cognitive strengths and weaknesses.},

abstract="One of the most obvious ``facts of life'' to all teachers, at every level of education, is the phenomenon of individual differences---in mental abilities, special talents, and traits of personality. Especially salient are those characteristics of pupils that are the most clearly related to the success of teachers' efforts to impart knowledge and intellectual skills. The most prominent of such characteristics is general mental ability, or intelligence. Consequently, the study of individual differences, especially differences in intelligence, has been one of four major themes of educational psychology (along with development, learning, and measurement) ever since this field was formally recognized as a branch of psychology.",

Current findings of modest to strong correlations between heritability and the g factor are based only on five studies, all from Western countries. We carried out a meta-analysis of Japanese studies reporting heritabilities of all subtests of IQ batteries to examine whether they would give the same outcomes as Western studies. g loadings of subtests were taken from various sources. Correlations between heritabilities and g loadings were computed for all data points. The meta-analysis was based on four studies yielding six data points and showed a meta-analytical correlation of .38 (total N=1808). We conclude that there is a clear link between the g factor and heritability coefficients in Japan, but that it contrasts with the quite strong correlations found in Western studies. Moderator analyses suggest that the shorter number of subtests and the smaller samples of twins used in Japanese studies partially explain the lower mean Japanese correlation. We discuss limitations of our study.}

      Raven's Coloured and/or Standard Progressive Matrices (CPM/SPM) from two 
      independent twin samples and correlated these estimates with group differences 
      on the same items. In Study 1, 199 pairs of 5- to 7-year-old monozygotic (MZ) and 
      dizygotic (DZ) twins reared together provided estimates of heritability and 
      environmentality for 36 puzzles from the CPM. These estimates correlated with 
      the differences between the twins and 94 Serbian Roma (both rs=0.32; Ns=36; 
      ps<0.05). In Study 2, 152 pairs of adult MZ and DZ twins reared apart provided 
      estimates of heritability and environmentality for 58 puzzles from the SPM. These 
      estimates correlated with the differences among 11 diverse samples including 
      (i) the reared-apart twins, (ii) another sample of Serbian Roma, and (iii) East 
      Asian, White, South Asian, Coloured and Black high school and university students

      variance in item pass rates, the heritabilities still correlated with the group 
      differences, although the environmentalities did not. Puzzles found relatively 
      difficult (or easy) by the twins were those found relatively difficult (or easy)

This article provides evidence that g has pervasive utility in work settings because it is essentially the ability to deal with cognitive complexity, in particular, with complex information processing. The more complex a work task, the greater the advantages that higher g confers in performing it well. Everyday tasks, like job duties, also differ in their level of complexity. The importance of intelligence therefore differs systematically across different arenas of social life as well as economic endeavor. Data from the National Adult Literacy Survey are used to show how higher levels of cognitive ability systematically improve individual's odds of dealing successfully with the ordinary demands of modern life (such as banking, using maps and transportation schedules, reading and understanding forms, interpreting news articles). These and other data are summarized to illustrate how the advantages of higher g, even when they are small, cumulate to affect the overall life chances of individuals at different ranges of the IQ bell curve. The article concludes by suggesting ways to reduce the risks for low-IQ individuals of being left behind by an increasingly complex postindustrial economy.}

    abstract = { Human intelligence (also called general intelligence, g, or Spearman’s g) is a highly useful psychological construct. Yet, since the middle of the 20th century, gifted education researchers have been reluctant to discuss human intelligence. The purpose of this article is to persuade gifted education researchers and practitioners to reincorporate modern human intelligence theory (as expressed in Cattell–Horn–Carroll, or CHC, theory) and research into their work on gifted children. There are five reasons to make intelligence part of gifted education research: (a) intelligence is one of the best studied constructs in psychology; (b) educators know more about how to adjust educational plans in response to intelligence than many other traits; (c) grounding research in CHC theory strengthens the links between gifted education and psychology, making gifted education more relevant to “outsiders”; (d) intelligence is an excellent predictor of long-term general life outcomes; and (e) many issues in gifted education (such as curriculum planning and underidentification) are best understood if considered in relation to intelligence and related cognitive abilities. The article ends with some caveats that gifted education researchers should keep in mind when integrating human intelligence research and CHC theory into their work. }

Among young adolescents in the top 1\% of quantitative reasoning ability, individual differences in general cognitive ability level and in specific cognitive ability pattern (that is, the relationships among an individual’s math, verbal, and spatial abilities) lead to differences in educational, occupational, and creative outcomes decades later. Whereas ability level predicts the level of achievement, ability pattern predicts the realm of achievement. Adding information on vocational interests refines prediction of educational and career choices. Finally, lifestyle preferences relevant to career choice, performance, and persistence often change between ages 25 and 35. This change results in sex differences in preferences, which likely have relevance for understanding the underrepresentation of women in careers that demand more than full-time (40 hours per week) commitment. }

abstract = {IQ scores provide the best general predictor of success in education, job training, and work. However, there are many ways in which IQ scores can be increased, for instance by means of retesting or participation in learning potential training programs. What is the nature of these score gains? Jensen [Jensen, A.R. (1998a). The g factor: The science of mental ability. London: Praeger] argued that the effects of cognitive interventions on abilities can be explained in terms of Carroll's three-stratum hierarchical factor model. We tested his hypothesis using test–retest data from various Dutch, British, and American IQ test batteries combined into a meta-analysis and learning potential data from South Africa using Raven's Progressive Matrices. The meta-analysis of 64 test–retest studies using IQ batteries (total N=26,990) yielded a correlation between g loadings and score gains of −1.00, meaning there is no g saturation in score gains. The learning potential study showed that: (1) the correlation between score gains and the g loadedness of item scores is −.39, (2) the g loadedness of item scores decreases after a mediated intervention training, and (3) low-g participants increased their scores more than high-g participants. So, our results support Jensen's hypothesis. The generalizability of test scores resides predominantly in the g component, while the test-specific ability component and the narrow ability component are virtually non-generalizable. As the score gains are not related to g, the generalizable g component decreases and, as it is not unlikely that the training itself is not g-loaded, it is easy to understand why the score gains did not generalize to scores on other cognitive tests and to g-loaded external criteria.}

abstract = {Allowing respondents to retake a cognitive ability test has shown to increase their test scores. Several theoretical models have been proposed to explain this effect, which make distinct assumptions regarding the measurement invariance of psychometric tests across test administration sessions with regard to narrower cognitive abilities and general mental ability. We modeled retest effects in four psychometric tests as a function of specific retest form and general mental ability in order to compare the validity of these models and their generalizability across three different kinds of retest forms. To do so automatic item generation was used to construct two kinds of alternate retest: (1) isomorphic retests and (2) psychometrically matched retests. A total of N=358 respondents completed all four measures twice, receiving either identical retest forms, isomorphic retest forms or psychometrically matched retest forms at the second test administration session. Item response theory modeling supported strict measurement invariance across all test forms and time-points of measurement but indicated variation in respondents' retest score gains due to individual differences in general mental ability and the kind of retest form used. In general, retest effects were more pronounced for high-g respondents, identical retests and isomorphic retest forms and for mental rotation and algebra word problems. Latent mean and covariance structure analyses indicated that retesting did not affect the g-factor saturation of the four cognitive ability tests but revealed that retest score gains were hollow with respect to psychometric g.}

Here, we report brain structure-intelligence associations on a large sample from the UK Biobank study. The overall N = 29,004, with N = 18,426 participants providing both brain MRI and at least one cognitive test, and a complete four-test battery with MRI data available in a minimum N = 7201, depending upon the MRI measure. Participants' age range was 44–81 years (M = 63.13, SD = 7.48). A general factor of intelligence (g) was derived from four varied cognitive tests, accounting for one third of the variance in the cognitive test scores. The association between (age- and sex- corrected) total brain volume and a latent factor of general intelligence is r = 0.276, 95% C.I. = [0.252, 0.300]. A model that incorporated multiple global measures of grey and white matter macro- and microstructure accounted for more than double the g variance in older participants compared to those in middle-age (13.6% and 5. 4%, respectively). There were no sex differences in the magnitude of associations between g and total brain volume or other global aspects of brain structure. The largest brain regional correlates of g were volumes of the insula, frontal, anterior/superior and medial temporal, posterior and paracingulate, lateral occipital cortices, thalamic volume, and the white matter microstructure of thalamic and association fibres, and of the forceps minor. Many of these regions exhibited unique contributions to intelligence, and showed highly stable out of sample prediction.}

In addition to confirmation of the small but significant relationship between IQ and whole brain volume (r = 0.25, p < .05) using magnetic resonance imaging, regional differences were examined using a completely automated procedure to generate lobar volumes to address questions related to regional specificity and its relationship to intelligence. A significant positive relationship was found between measures of full scale IQ and frontal (r = 0.25, p < .05) and temporal (r = 0.28, p < .01) regions, although when correlations across different brain regions were tested against each other, there was no evidence of regional specificity. In addition, no laterality effects were seen. Correlations between WAIS-R subtest scores and brain regions indicated few correlations between verbal subtest scores and brain size, but several significant correlations between the performance subtest scores and frontal, temporal, parietal, and cerebellar brain regions. These results support the notion of a modest relationship between brain size and measures of global intelligence and suggest diffuse brain involvement on performance tasks which require integration and use of multiple cognitive domains.}

abstract = {The processing volume theory of general intelligence predicts that brain volume imposes general constraints on the overall amounts of cortical substrate available for solving complex problems. Bigger brains contain more processing volume, hence can solve problems generally more efficiently than smaller brains. This theory predicts that the g loading of ability tests should substantially moderate the association between ability test performance and brain volume. This is tested with a bare-bones meta-analysis employing the method of correlated vectors (MCV) on the association between brain volume∗subtest correlations and subtest g loadings. The mean weighted vector correlation across four studies is ρ=0.07 (total N=246), increasing to ρ=0.35 when one potentially outlying study is removed. The magnitude of these Jensen effects suggests that g plays at best only a modest role in moderating the strength of the brain volume∗IQ correlation, contrary to predictions from the processing volume theory. This result is consistent with the observation that brain volume has low evolutionary lability compared with g, suggesting that recent evolutionary changes in population levels of g may have occurred largely independently of overall changes in brain volume.}

However, multiple meta-analyses have led to considerable differences in summary effect estimations, thus failing to provide a plausible effect estimate. Here we aim at resolving this issue by providing the largest meta-analysis and systematic review so far of the brain volume and IQ association (86 studies; 454 effect sizes from k = 194 independent samples; N = 26 000+) in three cognitive ability domains (full-scale, verbal, performance IQ). By means of competing meta-analytical approaches as well as combinatorial and specification curve analyses, we show that most reasonable estimates for the brain size and IQ link yield r-values in the mid-0.20s, with the most extreme specifications yielding rs of 0.10 and 0.37. Summary effects appeared to be somewhat inflated due to selective reporting, and cross-temporally decreasing effect sizes indicated a confounding decline effect, with three quarters of the summary effect estimations according to any reasonable specification not exceeding r = 0.26, thus contrasting effect sizes were observed in some prior related, but individual, meta-analytical specifications. Brain size and IQ associations yielded r = 0.24, with the strongest effects observed for more g-loaded tests and in healthy samples that generalize across participant sex and age bands. }

Strong empirical links exist between fluid intelligence and processing speed on the one hand, and white matter integrity and processing speed on the other. We propose a watershed model that integrates these three explanatory levels in a principled manner in a single statistical model, with processing speed and white matter figuring as intermediate endophenotypes. We fit this model in a large (N=555) adult lifespan cohort from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) using multiple measures of processing speed, white matter health and fluid intelligence. The model fit the data well, outperforming competing models and providing evidence for a many-to-one mapping between white matter integrity, processing speed and fluid intelligence. The model can be naturally extended to integrate other cognitive domains, endophenotypes and genotypes.}

abstract={Interest in emotional intelligence (EI) has shown this same pattern of explosive growth. Prior to 1995, there were only a handful of researchers seriously interested in EI, and there were few EI tests, training programs, or interventions. EI has been described by enthusiasts as both highly important and broadly relevant (most notably, Goleman, 1995, 1998), and it has attracted both a dedicated core of true believers and an equally dedicated cohort of skeptics and critics. Is Is EI a fad? If so, so what? Labeling something a fad does not mean that it is a bad idea (although many of the fads cataloged in this chapter represent profoundly bad ideas), nor does it mean that claims currently made for EI will turn out to be unsupportable. This chapter examines existing fads, including psychology fads, management fads, and education fads, and discusses methods of diagnosing fads. Finally, the authors explore whether EI is a fad, and suggest that the practice-driven version of El looks like a fad, whereas the science-driven version seems less fad-like.

abstract = {Abstract In the past decade, the concept of emotional intelligence (EI) has emerged as a potential new construct for explaining behavioral variance not accounted for by traditional measures of general academic intelligence or personality. EI researchers credit E. L. Thorndike as the first to propose such a construct when he suggested that social intelligence is independent of abstract or academic intelligence. The current paper traces the historical roots of social intelligence and the current scientific status of emotional intelligence. It appears that emotional intelligence, as a concept related to occupational success, exists outside the typical scientific domain. Much of the data necessary for demonstrating the unique association between EI and work-related behavior appears to reside in proprietary databases, preventing rigorous tests of the measurement devices or of their unique predictive value. For those reasons, any claims for the value of EI in the work setting cannot be made under the scientific mantle. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Abstract Empirical studies of cognitive ability and personality have tended to operate in isolation of one another. We suggest that returning to a unified approach to considering the development of individual differences in both cognition and personality can enrich our understanding of human development. We draw on previous meta-analyses of longitudinal, behavior genetic studies of cognition and personality across the life span, focusing particular attention on age trends in heritability and differential stability. Both cognition and personality are moderately heritable and exhibit large increases in stability with age; however, marked differences are evident. First, the heritability of cognition increases substantially with child age, while the heritability of personality decreases modestly with age. Second, increasing stability of cognition with age is overwhelmingly mediated by genetic factors, whereas increasing stability of personality with age is entirely mediated by environmental factors. Third, the maturational time-course of stability differs: Stability of cognition nears its asymptote by the end of the first decade of life, whereas stability of personality takes three decades to near its asymptote. We discuss how proximal gene–environment dynamics, developmental processes, broad social contexts, and evolutionary pressures may intersect to give rise to these divergent patterns.},

This fact has important implications for research and theory building in psychology, as evidence of genetic influence unleashes a cascade of questions regarding the sources of variance in such traits. A brief list of those questions is provided, and representative findings regarding genetic and environmental influences are presented for the domains of personality, intelligence, psychological interests, psychiatric illnesses, and social attitudes. These findings are consistent with those reported for the traits of other species and for many human physical traits, suggesting that they may represent a general biological phenomenon. }

abstract={In this chapter, we provide an overview of cross-cultural studies of personality that have involved a sufficiently large number of different countries or territories. Although there is no definitive answer regarding the number of countries that is sufficient, we can rely on common sense. If researchers are lucky to recruit many participants from one country or a region, who have completed a personality questionnaire, then it is common to compute the mean scores of those responses in order to characterize the country or region as a whole on these personality traits. For example, let us suppose that researchers have decided to measure conscientiousness, which can be exemplified by an individual who is purposeful, strong-willed, reliable, and determined. When we learn that the highest culture-level mean scores of conscientiousness, obtained by averaging the scores of all respondents in each cultural sample, are found in Benin and Burkina Faso, while the lowest scoring countries are Japan and Korea, one is immediately prompted by a question about the validity of these culture-level aggregate personality scores. The aforementioned findings are certainly puzzling because they challenge our intuition about personality dispositions being in harmony or at least reflecting to some extent the countries' socioeconomic progress. Since the construct and criterion-related validity of personality tests have been well established at the individual level, the intriguing question obviously pertains to the validity and meaningfulness of aggregate personality scores as indicators of the personality profiles of cultures. In this chapter we adopted the following premise: the best (but not necessarily only) way to answer this and related questions is to carry out and analyze large-scale personality studies involving many different countries or regions that differ not only in language but also in cultural values, religion, political regime, and economic development.

Two studies examined the relationship between different mental abilities and high school grades. Study 1 showed that the personality trait conscientiousness predicted high school grades (r=.32) almost as well as g (r=.37 to .40). In Study 2, the relationship between general mental ability (g) and high school grades was linear and fairness analyses indicated slight overprediction for Hispanics and Blacks and underprediction for females. Validity was lowered slightly by group preferences. With the exception of mathematical knowledge, the correlation between mental abilities and high school grades in both studies was largely attributable to g rather than specific abilities (s) measured by each test. Additional analyses showed that grade point averages are reliable and conscientiousness and g do not interact when predicting high school grades.}

In the present article, we revisit this controversy, identify unresolved issues, and provide a fresh look at the key questions. Our independent replication and extension using a large representative sample of German ninth-grade students (N=13.648) demonstrates that achievement and intelligence tests are highly but not perfectly correlated. Personality accounts for a substantial share of the variance in achievement but only a small share of that in intelligence. Importantly, personality incrementally explains variance in achievement above and beyond intelligence. Whereas standardized achievement measures are a good (but not “pure”) indicator of cognitive ability, this problem of confounding is particularly pressing for school grades, which are only modestly correlated with intelligence and highly laden with personality. We discuss theoretical implications and recommend that studies aiming to identify the effects of cognitive ability on life outcomes routinely control for personality.}

Most predictors yielded significant mean differences between sexes. Intelligence and ability self-perceptions were the strongest predictors of grades in all domains. In Math, additional predictors of grades were Conscientiousness and Neuroticism. Grades in German and English were also predicted by the interaction between sex and Extraversion. While for girls a higher level of Extraversion was associated with better grades, the opposite was true for boys. Only in German, there was an additional interaction between sex and verbal intelligence indicating that girls benefit even more than boys from a high level of verbal intelligence.}

Motivation significantly predicted test scores. A substantial performance gap emerged between students in different motivational conditions (effect size as large as .68). Depending on the test format and condition, conclusions about college learning gain (i.e., value added) varied dramatically from substantial gain (d = 0.72) to negative gain (d = −0.23).

    abstract = { Advocates of high-stakes testing argue that providing strong incentives for students to take learning more seriously will result in greater student effort and motivation. Opponents argue that these policies set up low-achieving students to fail, looking to research on motivation for evidence that extrinsic and negative incentives such as the threat of retention will undermine students' engagement in school. This article seeks to evaluate these claims by examining the responses of 102 low-achieving sixth- and eighth-grade students to Chicago's highly publicized effort to end social promotion. Does this policy lead students to work harder? If so, to what extent does hard work pay off? The majority of these students described increased work effort under the policy. They reported greater attention to class work, increased academic press and support from teachers, and more time spent studying outside school. These efforts were confirmed by teachers' reports. Students with high levels of work effort generally had greater-than-average learning gains and positive promotional outcomes. Approximately one third, however, showed little work effort despite a desire not to be retained. These students faced significantly larger skill gaps and barriers to learning both within and outside school than did their peers with high work effort. How teachers manage high-stakes testing policies—whether they create environments that make low-achieving students feel supported and efficacious in responding to new demands and whether they direct students' efforts in productive ways—has an important impact on student motivation and passing rates. }

However, the degree to which undergraduate first-year psychology volunteers, a commonly used source of participants in low-stakes research, may be motivated to complete a battery of intelligence tests has not yet been tested. Furthermore, the assumption implies that the association between test-taking motivation and intelligence test performance is linear – an assumption untested, to date. Consequently, we administered a battery of five intelligence subtests to a sample of 219 undergraduate volunteers within the first 30 min of a low-stakes research setting. We also administered a reading comprehension test near the end of the testing session (55 min). Self-reported test-taking motivation was measured on three occasions: at the beginning (as a trait), immediately after the battery of five intelligence tests (state 1), and immediately after the reading comprehension test (state 2). Six percent of the sample was considered potentially insufficiently motivated to complete the intelligence testing, and 13% insufficiently motivated to complete the later administered reading comprehension test. Furthermore, test-taking motivation correlated positively with general intelligence test performance (r ≈ 0.20). However, the effect was non-linear such that the positive association resided entirely between the low to moderate levels of test-taking motivation. While simultaneously acknowledging the exploratory nature of this investigation, it was concluded that a moderate level of test-taking effort may be all that is necessary to produce intelligence test scores that are valid. However, in low-stakes research settings, cognitive ability testing that exceeds 25 to 30 min may be inadvisable, as test-taking motivational levels decrease to a degree that may be concerning for a non-negligible portion of the sample.}

This correlation could be interpreted in two ways: Students with greater propensity for intelligence go on to complete more education, or a longer education increases intelligence. We meta-analyzed three categories of quasiexperimental studies of educational effects on intelligence: those estimating education-intelligence associations after controlling for earlier intelligence, those using compulsory schooling policy changes as instrumental variables, and those using regression-discontinuity designs on school-entry age cutoffs. Across 142 effect sizes from 42 data sets involving over 600,000 participants, we found consistent evidence for beneficial effects of education on cognitive abilities of approximately 1 to 5 IQ points for an additional year of education. Moderator analyses indicated that the effects persisted across the life span and were present on all broad categories of cognitive ability studied. Education appears to be the most consistent, robust, and durable method yet to be identified for raising intelligence. }

Empirical evidence exists to the effect that different explicit measures based on different theoretical concepts build one construct. For implicit measures, however, such evidence is lacking. Thus, scores on three implicit and three explicit achievement motivation measures, an intelligence test, and a Big 5 questionnaire were obtained (N = 150) as well as two criteria. The explicit achievement motivation measures were classified as being based either on Murray’s or on McClelland’s theory.

We examined the evidentiary strength of six key premises of mind-set theory in 438 participants; we reasoned that strongly worded claims should be supported by equally strong evidence. However, no support was found for most premises. All associations (rs) were significantly weaker than .20. Other achievement-motivation constructs, such as self-efficacy and need for achievement, have been found to correlate much more strongly with presumed associates of mind-set. The strongest association with mind-set (r = −.12) was opposite from the predicted direction. The results suggest that the foundations of mind-set theory are not firm and that bold claims about mind-set appear to be overstated. }

abstract = {Intelligence mindset refers to one's belief that either intelligence is a malleable trait that can improve with effort—a “growth” mindset—or is a relatively stable trait—a “fixed” mindset. According to proponents of mindset theory, holding a growth mindset is beneficial (e.g., greater academic persistence) while holding a fixed mindset is detrimental. Is there a relationship between one's intelligence mindset and one's intelligence? Proponents of mindset theory suggest that the answer is yes, and that this relationship differs by gender, with more intelligent females holding more of a fixed mindset (aka, the “bright girl effect”). However, investigations of all three factors—measured intelligence, intelligence mindset, and gender—have only been conducted with children and adolescents. Therefore, we tested whether, among adults, women have more of a fixed mindset than men, and whether women with higher intelligence are more likely to hold fixed mindsets. We found no evidence for women holding fixed mindsets more so than men. We found very limited evidence for a “bright woman effect”: Three-way interactions between age, gender, and intelligence predicting mindset emerged, however, the relationships were not consistently driven by brighter women (young or old) holding more of a fixed mindset than their less intelligent female counterparts or men. Furthermore, we did not find evidence to support the notion that holding more of a growth mindset results in greater academic persistence. We conclude that neither gender nor intelligence is consistently associated with mindset.}

abstract = {Implicit theories of intelligence have been proposed to predict a large number of different outcomes in education. The belief that intelligence is malleable (growth mindset) is supposed to lead to better academic achievement and students' mindset is therefore a potential target for interventions. The present study used a large sample of university applicants (N=5653) taking a scholastic aptitude test to further examine the relationship between mindset and achievement in the academic domain. We found that results in the test were slightly negatively associated with growth mindset (r=−0.03). Mindset showed no relationship with the number of test administrations participants signed up for and it did not predict change in the test results. The results show that the strength of the association between academic achievement and mindset might be weaker than previously thought.}

    abstract = { Mind-sets (aka implicit theories) are beliefs about the nature of human attributes (e.g., intelligence). The theory holds that individuals with growth mind-sets (beliefs that attributes are malleable with effort) enjoy many positive outcomes—including higher academic achievement—while their peers who have fixed mind-sets experience negative outcomes. Given this relationship, interventions designed to increase students’ growth mind-sets—thereby increasing their academic achievement—have been implemented in schools around the world. In our first meta-analysis (k = 273, N = 365,915), we examined the strength of the relationship between mind-set and academic achievement and potential moderating factors. In our second meta-analysis (k = 43, N = 57,155), we examined the effectiveness of mind-set interventions on academic achievement and potential moderating factors. Overall effects were weak for both meta-analyses. However, some results supported specific tenets of the theory, namely, that students with low socioeconomic status or who are academically at risk might benefit from mind-set interventions. }

abstract = {Mindset theory predicts that whether students believe basic ability is greatly malleable exerts a major influence on their own educational attainment (Blackwell, Trzesniewski, & Dweck, 2007). We tested this prediction in two near-replication studies (total n = 832). In study 1 we tested the association of mindset with university grades in a cross-sectional design involving self-reported grades for 246 undergraduates. Growth mindset showed no association with grades (β = −0.02 CI95 [−0.16, 0.12], t = −0.26, p = .792). In study 2, we implemented a longitudinal design, testing the association of mindset with grade transcript scores across a series of challenging transitions: from high school to university entry, and then across all years of an undergraduate degree (n = 586). Contrary to prediction, mindset was not associated with grades across the challenging transition from high-school to the first year of university (β = −0.05 CI95 [−0.14, 0.05], t = −0.95, p = .345). In addition, mindset was unrelated to entry grades (p = .808). And no support was found for a predicted interaction of mindset with academic disadvantage across the transition (β = −0.03 CI95 [−0.12, 0.07], t = −0.54, p = .592). Follow-up analyses showed no association of mindset with improvement in grades at any subsequent year of the degree (minimum p-value 0.591). Jointly, these two near-replication studies suggest that, even across challenging transitions, growth mindset is either unrelated to educational attainment or has a very small negative influence.}

We find that, in terms of ΔR 2, intelligence contributes 48–90 times more than grit to educational success and 13 times more to job-market success. Conscientiousness also contributes to success more than grit but only twice as much. We show that the reason our results differ from those of previous studies which showed that grit has a stronger effect on success is that these previous studies used nonrepresentative samples that were range restricted on intelligence. Our findings suggest that although grit has some effect on success, it is negligible compared to intelligence and perhaps also to other traditional predictors of success. }

abstract = {The positive manifold associated with correlation matrices of diverse batteries of cognitive abilities has garnered a substantial amount of psychometric and theoretical consideration. General (g) factor theorists purport the positive manifold to be due to a g factor, which is believed to be representative of an important psychological construct. By contrast, the dynamic mutualism theory of the positive manifold asserts that it is an epiphenomenon, which emerges progressively during development, as a consequence of mutually beneficial interactions between originally uncorrelated cognitive processes. To test the competing dynamic mutualism versus g factor theories of the g factor, the strength of the g factor (as estimated by omega hierarchical, ωh) was plotted across the ages of 2.5 to 90years (N=5200). Although there was an observed increase in ωh from the ages of 2.5 to approximately 10.0, the observed slope was weak in magnitude. Furthermore, the results based on the mean of the bifactor model g loadings suggested that much, if not all, of the upward slope in ωh was due to differences in the number of subtests across age groups. Consequently, the results are interpreted to suggest that the dynamic mutualism theory of g was failed to be confirmed, however, important limitations associated with this investigation are highlighted and an alternative explanation is presented.}

The present study compared infant Bayley factor scores representing separable dimensions of infant cognition with parental general and specific cognitive abilities for 182 adoptive families and 164 nonadoptive families. Parent/offspring correlations between 12-month Bayley factors and parental cognitive abilities suggest only minimal relationships for both parental g and specific abilities. At 24 months, more parent/offspring resemblance was present; moreover, Bayley factors that were related to parental cognition tended to be related to parental g, not to specific abilities. The finding of significant parent/offspring relationships at 24 months between biological parents and their adopted-away infants, as well as between nonadoptive parents and their infants, suggests some genetic continuity from infancy to adulthood.}

Additionally, van der Maas and Kan (2016) do not believe in the interpretation of the results reported in Gignac (2014). As a response to van der Maas et al. (2016), it is noted that, contrary to van der Maas et al. (2016), the g-factor was not proposed by Gignac (2014, 2016) as the only factor of intelligence. Secondly, there is arguably no reason to consider the g factor a mysterious latent variable. Thirdly, the simulation results reported in van der Maas and Kan (2016) simply demonstrated that a very highly parameterised mutualism model may be a possible alternative representation of the positive manifold, rather than a plausible one that may be expected to replicate across samples. Intelligent researchers will likely continue to disagree about g. Based on individual differences research relevant to non-intellective predictors of the inclination to accept various scientific propositions, I conclude with the suggestion that belief in the plausibility of the g factor (or mutualism) may be impacted significantly by individual differences in personality, attitudes, and worldviews, rather than rely strictly upon logical and/or empirical evidence.}

A meta-analytic sample-weighed correlation of −.51 was found, which became −.80 after corrections for measurement error. We conclude that the pattern in Headstart gains on subtests of an IQ battery is highly similar to the pattern in test–retest gains and is hollow with respect to g. So, Headstart leads to gains in IQ scores, but not to gains in g. We discuss this finding in relation to the Flynn effect, training effects, and heritability.}

To date, PP has found support through its success in offering compelling explanations for a number of perceptual, cognitive, and psychiatric phenomena, as well as from accumulating neurophysiological evidence. However, its implications for understanding intelligence and its neural basis have received relatively little attention. The present review outlines the key tenets and evidence for PP, and assesses its implications for intelligence research. It is argued that PP suggests indeterminacy as a unifying principle from which to investigate the cognitive hierarchy and brain-ability correlations. The resulting framework not only accommodates prominent psychometric models of intelligence, but also incorporates key findings from neuroanatomical and functional activation research, and motivates new predictions via the mechanisms of prediction-error minimization. Because PP also suggests unique neural signatures of experience-dependent activity, it may also help clarify environmental contributions to intellectual development. It is concluded that PP represents a plausible, integrative framework that could enhance progress in the neuroscience of intelligence.}
