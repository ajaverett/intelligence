# Isn't _g_ a statistical artifact?

There are many cognitive batteries that specifically do not try to look for ‘g’, some of which expressly try to avoid it. 

- Researchers for the British Ability Scales lament that “there is little evidence that strong primary factors… have accounted for any substantial proportion of the common variance of the British Ability Scales. This is despite the fact that the scales sample a wide range of psychological functions.” It asks What, then, are we to make of the results of these analyses? Do they mean that we are back to square one, as it were, and that after 60 years of research we have turned full circle and are back with the theories of Spearman?” (Elliott 1986). 

- The CAS Battery is based on the Soviet inspired PASS theory which disavows _g_ and asserts that intelligence consists of four processes called Planning, Attention-Arousal, Simultaneous, and Successive. The CAS was designed to assess these four processes. However, Keith el al. 2001 did a joint confirmatory factor analysis of the CAS together with the WJ-III battery, concluding that not only does the CAS not measure the constructs it was designed to measure, but that notwithstanding the test makers’ aversion to g, the g factor derived from the CAS is large and statistically indistinguishable from the g factor of the WJ-III. The CAS therefore appears to be the opposite of what it was supposed to be: an excellent test of the “non-existent” g and a poor test of the supposedly real non-g abilities it was painstakingly designed to measure. 

- The triarchic theory of intelligence originated as an alternative to the concept of general intelligence factor, or g. (Vinney 2020; Brody 2003a, 2003b) analyzed Sternbergs work and finds a general factor of intelligence. Additionally, with tests that are radically different, Confirmatory Factor Analysis showed that different cognitive batteries (CAB, Hawaii Battery, WAIS) were analyzed, and it turned out that the g factors computed from the three tests (five tests in Johnson 2008) were statistically indistinguishable from one another, despite the fact that the tests tapped into partly different sets of abilities. (Johnson, 2004, 2008). 

On a biological level, it has been established beyond any dispute that cognitive abilities are heritable. (Poldeman 2015) Higher g-loadings correlate to higher heritabilities (Rushton & Jensen 2010). Quantitative genetic analyses indicate that g is an even stronger genetic variable than it is a phenotypic variable. (Plomin & Spinath 2004)
